Practice starts,"9.1 Practice starts may be carried after the pit exit on the left-hand side using one of the painted grid boxes, as in the image below.
2
9.2 For the avoidance of doubt, practice starts may not be carried out during Qualifying Sessions.
9.3 Practice starts after each free practice will be done according to Article 38.3 of Sporting Regulations.
9.4 If any free practice is resumed with less than 2 minutes remaining, for the purpose of facilitating practice starts on the grid as provided for in Article 38.3 of the Sporting Regulations, any car wishing to leave the pit lane must proceed down the pit lane without undue delay and exit the pit lane without leaving a significant gap to the car ahead.
10. Article 34.8 SR (…) Any car(s) driven to the end of the pit lane prior to the start or re-start of a free practice session, qualifying session must form up in a line in the fast lane and leave in the order they got there (...)
It is noted that a car will be considered to be “in the fast lane’ when a tyre has crossed the solid white line separating the fast lane from the inner lane, in this context crossing means that all of a tyre should be beyond the far side, with respect to the garages, of the line separating the fast lane from the inner lane.
For the avoidance of doubt, ISC Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 5b) states that:
Once a car has left its garage or pit stop position it should blend into the fast lane as soon as it is safe to do so, and without unnecessarily impeding cars which are already in the fast lane.
Thus, after the start or re-start of a free practice session, qualifying session, if there is a suitable gap in a queue of cars in the fast lane, such that a driver can blend into the fast lane safely and without unnecessarily impeding cars already in the fast lane, they are free to do so.
Furthermore, it is noted that during a free practice session and qualifying session a car driving in the inner lane, parallel to the fast lane, will not be considered to have blended into the fast lane at the earliest opportunity.
Additionally, ISC Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 5d) states that:
Cars in either the fast lane or working lane may not overtake other cars in the fast lane except in exceptional circumstances.
In this context a “stopped car’ is one which has an obvious mechanical problem.
11. Driving in the Pit Lane During the Race
This event is at a track where the pit lane is narrow.
For the safe and orderly conduct of this event, when released from their pit stop position during the race, all cars so released shall be responsible for ensuring that they blend into the fast lane as quickly as possible in a safe and orderly manner without unnecessarily impeding any car already in the fast lane. If this requires the released car to slow down sufficiently to allow car(s) in the fast lane to pass them, then that is what the released car should do.
For the avoidance of doubt, in this case a car will be considered to have entered the fast lane when all parts of the car have crossed the line separating the fast lane from the inner lane.
12. Lines at the Pit Entry and Pit Exit
12.1 In accordance with Chapter 4, Article 4 and 6 of Appendix L to the ISC drivers must follow the procedures at pit entry and pit exit.
12.2 Pertaining to Chapter 4, Article 4 of Appendix L to the ISC any driver crossing the blue highlighted white line in the pit entry road will be considered as entering the pit lane.
12.3 Drivers travelling in the pit entry road must stay to the left of the solid white line on the right-hand side.
12.4 Drivers travelling in the pit exit road must stay to the left of the solid white line on the right-hand side.
12.5 For the safe and orderly conduct of the event, during any live session, team personnel are not allowed to cross the white line near the pit entry, as indicated in the picture below.
12.6 During the reconnaissance laps prior to the race drivers are allowed to cross the white line separating the pit exit road from the circuit in the pit exit road.",2025_canadian_grand_prix_-_race_directors_event_notes_v2.txt

Practice starts,"No practice starts may be carried out at pit exit.

Practice starts after each free practice will be done according to Article 38.3 of Sporting Regulations.

If any free practice is resumed with less than 2 minutes remaining, for the purpose of facilitating practice starts on the grid as provided for in Article 38.3 of the Sporting Regulations, any car wishing to leave the pit lane must proceed down the pit lane without undue delay and exit the pit lane without leaving a significant gap to the car ahead.

It is noted that a car will be considered to be “in the fast lane” when a tyre has crossed the solid white line separating the fast lane from the inner lane, in this context crossing means that all of a tyre should be beyond the far side, with respect to the garages, of the line separating the fast lane from the inner lane.

For the avoidance of doubt, ISC Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 5b) states that:

Once a car has left its garage or pit stop position it should blend into the fast lane as soon as it is safe to do so, and without unnecessarily impeding cars which are already in the fast lane.

Thus, after the start or re-start of a free practice session, qualifying session, if there is a suitable gap in a queue of cars in the fast lane, such that a driver can blend into the fast lane safely and without unnecessarily impeding cars already in the fast lane, they are free to do so.

Furthermore, it is noted that during a free practice session and qualifying session a car driving in the inner lane, parallel to the fast lane, will not be considered to have blended into the fast lane at the earliest opportunity.

Additionally, ISC Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 5d) states that:

Cars in either the fast lane or working lane may not overtake other cars in the fast lane except in exceptional circumstances.

In this context a “stopped car” is one which has an obvious mechanical problem.",2025_monaco_grand_prix_-_race_directors_event_notes_.txt
Driving in the Pit Lane During the Race,"This event is at a track where the pit lane is narrow.

For the safe and orderly conduct of this event, when released from their pit stop position during the race, all cars so released shall be responsible for ensuring that they blend into the fast lane as quickly as possible in a safe and orderly manner without unnecessarily impeding any car already in the fast lane. If this requires the released car to slow down sufficiently to allow car(s) in the fast lane to pass them, then that is what the released car should do.

For the avoidance of doubt, in this case a car will be considered to have entered the fast lane when all parts of the car have crossed the line separating the fast lane from the inner lane.",2025_monaco_grand_prix_-_race_directors_event_notes_.txt
Lines at the Pit Entry and Pit Exit,"In accordance with Chapter 4, Article 4 and 6 of Appendix L to the ISC drivers must follow the procedures at pit entry and pit exit.

Post-Qualifying drivers weighing,"Any driver who finished participating in the qualifying sessions after Q1 and Q2 must proceed through the pit lane directly to the FIA scales immediately after they have returned to their team’s garage. The drivers may not drink anything or do anything which increases their weight before it is recorded by the FIA.

Any driver who stops on the track during the qualifying sessions and is not required to visit the Medical Centre, must proceed to the FIA scales to get his weight recorded before returning to his team.

Drivers who finish within the top 10 must proceed to the FIA scales immediately when out of their cars without contact with any other person.",2025_monaco_grand_prix_-_race_directors_event_notes_.txt

Any car that cuts the chicane at Turn 10/Turn 11 and gains a position must return that position before T12. Returning a position after turn 12 will not be considered a mitigating factor and will be reported as such for subsequent investigation by the Stewards.

Any car that cuts the chicane at Turn 10/Turn 11 on their in lap for a pit stop and subsequently gains a position after the pit stop as a result, will be reported for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage.",2025_monaco_grand_prix_-_race_directors_event_notes_.txt
Unsafe or Unknown ERS Status,"If the status of the ERS changes to unsafe or unknown, the relevant team will be required to send mechanics to the area in front of race control building at pit entry after the session. They will then be picked up by car to bring them to their car.
