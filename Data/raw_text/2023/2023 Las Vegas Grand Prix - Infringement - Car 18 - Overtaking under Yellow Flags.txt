The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 21:24
Session Practice 3
Fact Car 18 overtook Car 55 in a waved double yellow flag zone.
InfringementBreach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 5 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
3 penalty points (total of 5 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 8 (Lance Stroll), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, telemetry, and in-car video
evidence.
Double yellow flags were waved at Marshal Post 12.9 as Car 18 approached that
point along the straight. After passing the flags, which were clearly visible on the
onboard video from Car 18, Car 18 overtook Car 55.
The driver of Car 18 stated he had his “head down” looking at his dash and was
concentrating on the Ferrari ahead of him and missed the flags. Although there were
no yellow light panels displayed, the regulations are clear that the flags and light
panels have the same meaning.
Accordingly the standard penalty guidelines have been applied as to penalty.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
