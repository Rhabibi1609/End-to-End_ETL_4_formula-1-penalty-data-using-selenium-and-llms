From The Stewards Document 21
To The Team Manager, Date 17 November 2023
Scuderia Ferrari
Time 01:42
Having received a report from the FIA Technical Delegate concerning Car 55 (Document 16) stating
that the Survival Cell, Internal Combustion Engine, Energy Store and Control Electronics were
damaged beyond repair following an impact with a foreign object; and
Having received a request from the Competitor requesting a derogation of the Sporting Regulations
in order to allow a replacement of the Energy Store from outside the pool, without penalty; and
Having heard from the Team Representative, the Director FIA Single Seater Department, having
viewed video evidence and examined the Team’s declaration sheet, the Stewards, determine that
notwithstanding the fact that the damage was caused by highly unusual external circumstances,
Article 2.1 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations obliges all officials, including the Stewards, to apply
the regulations as they are written.
Accordingly, the mandatory penalty specified under Article 28.3 of the Sporting Regulations must be
applied.
The Stewards note that if they had the authority to grant a derogation in what they consider in this
case to be mitigating, unusual and unfortunate circumstances, they would have done so, however the
regulations do not allow such action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in
accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial
and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant
regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
