2023 AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX
30 June - 02 July 2023
From The Stewards Document 73
To All Teams, All Officials Date 02 July 2023
Time 19:47
The Stewards having received a protest from Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team, having
summoned (Doc 70) and heard from the Team Representative (Andy Stevenson), Nikolas Tombazis
representing the FIA and Diego Ioverno representing Scuderia Ferrari, have considered the
following matter and determine the following:
Time: 1655 hrs (Publication of Provisional Classification)
Session: Race
The protest was lodged against the accuracy of the Provisional Classification.
The Stewards first considered if the protest was admissible.
The Stewards determined that as it was lodged on time and complied with the requirements of
Chapter 13 of the FIA International Sporting Code, it was an admissible protest.
An examination of the list of deleted lap times provided to the Stewards by Race Control, revealed
that a number of track limit infringements had not previously been referred to the Stewards for
potential penalty. It was determined that some of these infringements warranted a penalty that was
not previously applied when the Provisional Classification was published.
These penalties will be reflected in the Final Classification.
Accordingly, the Protest is upheld and the Protest Fee is returned to the Competitor.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in
accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial
and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant
regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
