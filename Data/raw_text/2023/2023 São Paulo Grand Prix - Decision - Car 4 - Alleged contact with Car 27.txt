Time 14:14
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 17 & 18)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren F1 Team
Time 12:03
Session Practice 1
Fact Turn 12 incident between Cars 4 and 27 at 12:03.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 4 (Lando Norris), the driver of Car 27
(Nico Hulkenberg), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car
video evidence.
NOR was on a consistent flying lap when he caught up with HUL, who was on an out
lap, before T12. HUL stayed on the racing line when NOR overtook him on the left.
Just before turning into the corner, NOR kept a straight line while HUL was just about
to turn into the left-hand corner. This caused light contact between HUL’s left front
wheel and NOR’s right rear wheel. Both drivers contributed to the contact and none of
them is predominantly to blame for the incident.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
