Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race of the Australian GP, car number 01 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for
more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the front and rear sprung suspension components, the
front and rear inboard suspension components, all front and rear dampers as well as all attached
sensors logging suspension travel (including their signal against suspension travel).
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2023 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
