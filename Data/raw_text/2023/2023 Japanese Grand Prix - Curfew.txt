Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the McLaren Formula 1 Team, who are associated with the operation
of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the fourteen hour period which commenced
at 17:30 on 21 September, eighteen hours before the scheduled start time of P1 and ends four
hours before the scheduled start time of P1 at 07:30 on 22 September.
This was the first of the three individual exceptions permitted for the McLaren Formula 1 Team
during the 2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
