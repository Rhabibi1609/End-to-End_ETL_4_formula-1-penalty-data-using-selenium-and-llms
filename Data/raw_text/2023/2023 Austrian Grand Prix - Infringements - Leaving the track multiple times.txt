The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter

Reason Penalties have been applied as follows:
For four infringements, a 5 second time penalty; for five infringements, a 10
second time penalty. Then a “reset” has been allowed due to the excessive
number of infringements. The counting of infringements restarts. After another
four infringements, a 5 second time penalty will apply; after five, a 10 second time
penalty.
The Stewards very strongly recommend that a solution be found to the track limits
situation at this circuit.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
