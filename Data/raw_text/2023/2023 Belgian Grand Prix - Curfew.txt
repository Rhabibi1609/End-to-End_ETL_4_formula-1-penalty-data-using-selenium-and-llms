Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Formula One Team, who are
associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the fourteen
hour period which commenced at 19:30 on 27 July, eighteen hours before the scheduled start time
of P1 and ends four hours before the scheduled start time of P1 at 09:30 on 28 July.
This was the first of the six individual exceptions permitted for the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant
Formula One Team during the 2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action
should be taken.
