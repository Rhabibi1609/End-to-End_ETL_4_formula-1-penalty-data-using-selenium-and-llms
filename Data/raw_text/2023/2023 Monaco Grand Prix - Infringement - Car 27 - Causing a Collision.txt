Time 15:24
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 27 - Nico Hulkenberg
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 15:03
Session Race
Fact Causing a collision
Infringment Breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 2 for the 12 month period)
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence.
Hulkenberg caused a collision on the inside of Turn 6 on the first lap. The Stewards
considered that as he dove in and was unable to control the car and was not forced
there by any other car this does not get the benefit of the doubt of a first lap incident.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
