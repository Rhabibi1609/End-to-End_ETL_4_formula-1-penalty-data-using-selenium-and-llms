The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton
Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team
Time 20:03
Session Race
Fact Causing a collision.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Cars 44, 63 and 1 entered Turn 1 three-wide with Car 44 trying to make a move on
Car 63 around the outside. When turning in, the rear-right wheel of Car 44 made
contact with the front left edge of Car 63, causing Car 44 to spin off track. Car 63
also spun but was able to continue the race after that.
Whilst the argument can be made that Car 44 was predominantly at fault, the
Stewards, taking into account that the incident happened in Lap 1 and several cars
were involved, determine that the incident is considered as a typical “Lap 1, Turn 1”
incident and no driver is wholly at fault. Therefore no further action is taken.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
