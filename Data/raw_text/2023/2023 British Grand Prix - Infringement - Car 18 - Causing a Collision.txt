InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 7 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
The Stewards considered that Gasly was ahead at the apex of Turn 16 and was
entitled to the line at the exit before Turn 17. Stroll attempted to keep the line and as a
result had to drive off the circuit approaching the apex of Turn 17 which has a
significant sausage kerb. Stroll re-entered the circuit at an angle that caused him to
collide with Gasly.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
