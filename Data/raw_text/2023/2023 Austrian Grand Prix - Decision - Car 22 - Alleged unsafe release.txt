Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 16:22
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 15:32
Session Race
Fact Alleged failure to serve a penalty during a pit stop.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 54.4(c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason Video evidence from the FIA pit box overhead camera shows the jack moving
towards the front of the car as the car stops. It appears very close but after the
expiration of the 5 second time penalty, there appears to be a small further forward
movement leading us to have doubt as to whether the jack was touching the car
during the penalty period. In this case the competitor is given the benefit of the doubt.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented
