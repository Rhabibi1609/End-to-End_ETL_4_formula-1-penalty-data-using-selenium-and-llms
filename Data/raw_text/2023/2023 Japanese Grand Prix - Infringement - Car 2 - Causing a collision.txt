The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following

No / Driver 2 - Logan Sargeant

Time 14:15
Session Race
Fact Turn 11 incident between Cars 2 and 77.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 4 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, in-car video evidence.
BOT was about to overtake SAR at turn 11 on the outside. The Stewards determined
that SAR was predominantely to blame for the collision. Applying the 2023 Driving
Standard Guidelines for overtaking on the outside of a corner, the Stewards noted
that BOT left plenty of room for SAR, while he came alongside. SAR braked late,
locked his tyres and thereby caused the collision..
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
