The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake
Time 17:22
Session Sprint
Fact Car 24 forced Car 20 off the track at turn 1.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed, video and in-car video evidence.
Car 24 attempted a very late move on Car 20 up the inside into Turn 1, forcing Car
20 off track at the exit. Due to the track layout in that part of the track, Car 20 was
able to stay alongside and maintain his position, essentially resulting in both cars
ending up in the correct order and Car 24 giving back the position to Car 20. Taking
all this into account the Stewards decide to take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
