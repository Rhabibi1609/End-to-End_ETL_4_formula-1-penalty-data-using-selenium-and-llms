Time 19:05
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 29) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 2 - Logan Sargeant
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 15:17
Session Qualifying
Fact Failing to comply with a yellow flag in turn 3.
InfringementBreach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 10 grid positions for the next Sprint/Race in which the driver participates.
2 penalty points (total of 6 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2 (Logan Sargeant), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio
and in-car video evidence.
The driver of Car 2 stated that he overtook Car 22 because he appeared to be going
slowly and also because he saw the green panel ahead.
The Stewards determined however that this was a breach of the regulations. The fact
that a driver can see a green panel or flag ahead, does not mean that overtaking can
occur in what is still a yellow flag zone. Overtaking can only occur after passing the
green panel or flag.
It was also noted that he did not make a sufficient reduction in speed.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
