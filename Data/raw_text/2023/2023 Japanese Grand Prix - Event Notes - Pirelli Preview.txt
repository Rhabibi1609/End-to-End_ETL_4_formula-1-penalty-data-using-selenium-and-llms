Tyres notes
• Not permitted to switch tyres from their originally allocated position.
• Heating time temperature limits apply to the actual tyre surface
• Do not subject tyres to large deformation or heavy impact. temperature measured with the IR gun as detailed in the TD003
• Do not leave fitted tyres exposed at an air temperature lower than 10°C
and/or any excessive UV emission. • Cold cooling curve temperature limits apply to the tyre side wall
temperature measured with the probe as detailed in TD003
• Revised prescriptions could be issued during the race weekend in
accordance with TD003.
• BLANKET HEATING TIME for each temperature range to be counted from
• Cut-off time for fitting tyres at an event on sunday morning: 4 hours prior the moment the blanket control unit is set to reach its targeted temperature
to the race start within its correspondent interval.
