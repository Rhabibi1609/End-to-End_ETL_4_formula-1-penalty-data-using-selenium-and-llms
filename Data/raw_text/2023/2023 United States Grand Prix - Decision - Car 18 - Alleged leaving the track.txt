The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 14:48
Session Race
Fact Car 18 allegedly left the track at T12 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 c) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Car 18 made a move on Car 2 on the outside into Turn 12. He was in front at the
apex and to the exit and therefore had the right to the line. The driver of Car 2
defended his position on the inside, forcing Car 18 slightly off track at the exit.
However, due to the track layout in that part of the track, Car 18 was able to stay
alongside and maintain his position, essentially resulting in both cars ending up in the
correct order. Taking all this into account the Stewards decide to take no further
action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
