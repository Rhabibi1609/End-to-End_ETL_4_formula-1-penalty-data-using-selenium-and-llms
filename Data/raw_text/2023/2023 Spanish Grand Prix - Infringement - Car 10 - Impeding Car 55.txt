Time 19:40
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 25 & 26)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 10 - Pierre Gasly
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 16:14
Session Qualifying
Fact Unnecessary impeding of Car 55 by Car 10 in turn 13.
Infringment Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 0 (Pierre Gasly), the driver of Car 5​​ 5
(Carlos Sainz), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, team radio and in-car video evidence.
The driver of Car 10 stated he was aware that the second Ferrari (Car 55) was
behind but felt he could do nothing to avoid impeding because of the high speed delta
and closeness of Car 55 to Car 16. However it is the view of the Stewards that he
could have moved further to the right at the exit of turn 13.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
