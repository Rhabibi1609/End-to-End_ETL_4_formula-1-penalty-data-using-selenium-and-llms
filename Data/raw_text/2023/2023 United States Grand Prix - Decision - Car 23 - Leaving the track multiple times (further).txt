No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 15:25
Session Race
Fact Allegedly leaving the track without a justifiable reason multiple times in Turn 6.
InfringementAlleged breaches of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 c) of the International Sporting
Code and Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed in-car video evidence.
Based on the video footage available (which did not include CCTV), the Stewards
determine, whilst there might be some indication for possible track limit infringements
in Turn 6, the evidence at hand is not sufficient to accurately and consistently
conclude that any breaches occurred and therefore take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
