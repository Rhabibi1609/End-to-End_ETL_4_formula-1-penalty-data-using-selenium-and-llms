Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 18:55
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 38 & 39)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 15:39
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 22 unnecessarily impeded Car 44 in turn 13 at 15:39.
InfringementBreach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2​​ 2 (Yuki Tsunoda), the driver of Car 4​​ 4
(Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video and in-car video evidence.
Tsunoda was on the dry racing line at the exit of Turn 13 preparing for his fast lap and
had not fully come up to speed and therefore impeded Hamilton. Tsunoda explained
that he had been passed by another car and decided to remain slow in order to regain
his gap. In the opinion of the Stewards Tsunoda clearly had the ability to stay off the
line and therefore this impeding was unnecessary.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
