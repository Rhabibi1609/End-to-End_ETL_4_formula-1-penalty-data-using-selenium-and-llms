The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 21:17
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 1 unnecessarily impeding car 2 between Turns 17 and 18 at 21:17.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ (Max Verstappen), the driver of Car 2
(Logan Sargeant), the team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling
system data, video, team radio and in-car video evidence.
The driver of Car 1 stated that he was surrounded by many other cars on preparation
laps, some of which chose to overtake him on the left and some on the right, and
therefore he decided the safest option was for him to drive straight and keep the line,
leaving a car width on his right. He stated he felt any movement to the left or right
could have caused a collision with one of the cars around him. The Stewards accept
these statements.
The driver of Car 2 stated that he did not believe that the driver of Car 1 was at fault
and that there was room for him to pass.
We therefore determine that the driver of Car 1 did not unnecessarily impede Car 2.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
