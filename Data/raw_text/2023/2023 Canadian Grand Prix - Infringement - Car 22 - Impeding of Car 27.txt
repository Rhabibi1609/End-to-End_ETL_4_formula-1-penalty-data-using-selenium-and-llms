2023 CANADIAN GRAND PRIX
16 - 18 June 2023
From The Stewards Document 46
To The Team Manager, Date 17 June 2023
Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 20:12
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 34 & 35)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 16:23
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 22 unnecessarily impeded Car 27 in turn 10.
Infringment Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2​​ 2 (Yuki Tsunoda), the driver of Car 2​​ 7
(Nico Hulkenberg), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling
system data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence.
Car 27 and Car 22 were both on fast laps with 22 in front. Car 27 was gaining on Car
22 and going into Turn 10, Car 22 went wide and then came back on the track in front
of Car 27. The driver of Car 22 considered that he was still on his fast lap despite
the fact that at that point he was approximately 3 seconds slower than his previous
lap time.
We determine that the driver of Car 22 unnecessarily impeded Car 27. After going
wide at Turn 10 he could have abandoned his lap and kept off the racing line. This
would have avoided any impeding.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
