The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 40) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 00:17
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 18 appeared not to slow for a single waved yellow flag in Turn 5.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code and
non-compliance with Race Director’s Event Notes (item 3.1, document 34).
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 8 (Lance Stroll), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio
and in-car video evidence.
Examination of the telemetry and comparison with that of his team mate in Car 14,
revealed that the driver of Car 18 lifted off the throttle earlier than on his previous fast
lap, came back onto the throttle later than on his previous fast lap, and that his speed
into the corner was significantly less than on his previous fast lap and that of his team
mate.
Further his time in the yellow flag sector was greater than that on his fastest previous
lap notwithstanding that the lap times were improving as the session progressed due
to the evolution of the track.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
