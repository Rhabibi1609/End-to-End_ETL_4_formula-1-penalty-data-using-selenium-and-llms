The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter
and determine the following:
Session Qualifying
Fact The cars below exceeded the 1:41.0 time limit between the Safety Car lines.
No Car Driver Competitor Time of Day Lap
1 16 Charles Leclerc Scuderia Ferrari 16:08:40 L4 (Q1)
2 55 Carlos Sainz Scuderia Ferrari 16:08:49 L4 (Q1)
Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 4.2, document 20)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras.
Both drivers stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:41.0 around the
vast majority of the circuit and especially on the straights. However, in both cases
the Stewards determined that the drivers took appropriate actions to slow and stay
to the side to the track so as to not impede other drivers, and in both cases they did
this significantly to allow four drivers to pass while giving those drivers a clear track.
The Stewards therefore determine that they did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”,
and that evidently the reason they were both slightly above the maximum time was
due to their appropriate actions and take no further action.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
