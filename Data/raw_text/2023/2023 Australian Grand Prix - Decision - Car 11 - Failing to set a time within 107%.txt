The Stewards have received a request from Oracle Red Bull Racing to allow car 11 to start the race
despite failing to set a qualifying time within 107% of the fastest time set in Q1.
In accordance with Article 39.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations, the Stewards grant
permission for car 11, Sergio Perez, to start the race, as the driver has set satisfactory times in
practice at this Event. The car will be placed on the grid in accordance with Article 42.2 of the FIA
Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in
accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial
