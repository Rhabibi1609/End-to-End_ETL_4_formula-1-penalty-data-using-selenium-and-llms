Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake
Time 17:57
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 32 & 33)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team Stake
Time 15:14
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 24 impeded car 31 in turn 11.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 24 (Zhou Guanyu), the driver of Car 31
(Esteban Ocon), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car
video evidence.
Zhou was on an out lap during Q1 and was at the exit of Turn 11 and driving slowly on
the racing line and thereby impeded Ocon who was on a fast lap. However, in the
hearing Zhou explained that he had to go slow to avoid Hamilton in front of him and
had to stay on the left side of the track because as he entered the turn he was
passed on the right by Bottas and could not have moved off the line without causing
an unsafe situation. This was confirmed by his in-car camera. Both drivers agreed
that while Ocon was impeded there was not much that Zhou could have safely done in
the conditions to avoid the incident and thus the Stewards take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
