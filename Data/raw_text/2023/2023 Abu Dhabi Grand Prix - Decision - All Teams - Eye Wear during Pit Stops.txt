2023 ABU DHABI GRAND PRIX
24 - 26 November 2023
From The Stewards Document 61
To All Teams, All Officials Date 26 November 2023
Time 20:45
Respect of Article 34.13 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations
Having received reports from the Race Director and viewed video evidence, written reports from Pit
Marshals and heard from each of the Team Representatives, the Stewards determine that
numerous breaches of Article 34.13 appear to have occurred however the video evidence was in
some cases insufficiently clear to determine where for example, a visor was open, the team member
concerned may have been wearing glasses or other eye protection. Notwithstanding, there were
numerous examples of eye protection not being used.
The safety of team members is paramount. All Teams are requested to stress the importance of
eye protection for all personnel working on a car and ensure that this Article is respected by all team
members in the future.
