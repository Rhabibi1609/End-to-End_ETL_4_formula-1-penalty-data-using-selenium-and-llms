Reason The Stewards reviewed video, and in-car video evidence.
Russell was overtaking on the outside of Tsunoda on the front straight and into turn
one. Russell was ahead of Tsunoda at the braking point, but Tsunoda appeared to
brake a little later. Tsunoda was on the dirty inside line and having braked later he
then understeered into Russell. The Stewards determined that Tsunoda was
predominantly at fault for the collision.
