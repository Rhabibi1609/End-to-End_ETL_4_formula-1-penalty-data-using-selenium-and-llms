Technical Delegate’s Report
The following parts have been replaced during the Parc Fermé yesterday and today:
Aston Martin Mercedes:
Car 18: Floor assembly (different specification)
Sidepod bodywork panels (different specification)
Rear beam wing (different specification)
Rear anti roll bar (different specification)
Front brake friction material (different specification)
All the above listed parts have been replaced with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following
a written request from the team concerned, this being in accordance with Article 40.3 of the 2023
Formula One Sporting Regulations.
But as the above parts are different from the ones originally used and also changes have been made
to the set-up of the suspension (with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written
request), car number 18 should now be required to start from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 of
the 2023 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
