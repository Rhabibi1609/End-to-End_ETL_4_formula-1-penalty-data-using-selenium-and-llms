From The Stewards Document 63
To The Team Manager, Date 18 June 2023
MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 16:05
The Stewards, having received a report from the Media Delegate, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 20 - Kevin Magnussen
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 11:50
Session Pre-race
Fact The driver was five minutes late reporting to the Drivers’ Parade.
Infringment Breach of Article 19.4 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Non-driving).
This is the driver’s first reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards received a report from the Media Delegate that the the driver of Car 20
(Kevin Magnussen), was late for the driver’s parade. The Stewards noted the written
list of driver report times and determined that the driver was indeed late for the
parade.
The reason for the lateness was the team’s media and other commercial
commitments that the driver had to satisfy before turning up for the parade. We
considered that this was not a valid reason for the lateness. A driver turning up late
for such events can have undesirable resultant consequences for the event and
should be avoided at all times.
In the circumstances, we decided to impose a Reprimand (non-driving) on the driver.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
