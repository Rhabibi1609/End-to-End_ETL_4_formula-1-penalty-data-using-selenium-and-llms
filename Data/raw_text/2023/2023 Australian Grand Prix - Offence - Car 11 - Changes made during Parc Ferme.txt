The Stewards, having received a report from the Technical Delegate (document 38), have
considered the following matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 12:00
Session Qualifying
Fact The following Power Unit elements have been used and changes made to suspension
while under Parc Ferme.
3rd Energy Store (ES)
3rd Control Electronics (CE)
All Power Unit elements were replaced without the approval of the FIA Technical
Delegate during Parc Ferme.
Offence Breach of Article 40.9 c) and 40.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Required to start the race from the pit lane.
Reason The changed PU elements were replaced whilst the car was in parc ferme without the
approval of the Technical Delegate. Further changes were made to the suspension
with the approval of the Technical Delegate. As such this setup is different from what
was run in Qualifying.
As the PU elements were changed without prior approval of the Technical Delegate
this is not in accordance with Article 40.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting
Regulations. The competitor is therefore required to start the race from the pit lane
per article 40.9 c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
