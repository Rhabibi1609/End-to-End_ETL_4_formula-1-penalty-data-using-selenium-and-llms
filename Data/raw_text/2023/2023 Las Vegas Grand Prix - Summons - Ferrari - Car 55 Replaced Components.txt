Time 00:43
The team representative is required to report to the Stewards at 01:00, in relation to a report
received from the FIA Technical Delegate and a subsequent request from the Team for a derogation
to the Sporting Regulations in order to replace an energy storage outside the pool without penalty.
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Reason During the first practice session, Car 55 was damaged due to a contact with a faulty
drain. It appears that components which are restricted by the Formula One Sporting
Regulations have to be replaced. This could potentially lead to a breach of Article
28.2 the Formula One Sporting Regulations.
