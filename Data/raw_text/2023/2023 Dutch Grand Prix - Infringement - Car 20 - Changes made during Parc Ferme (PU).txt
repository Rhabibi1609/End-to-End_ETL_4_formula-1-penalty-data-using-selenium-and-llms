Fact The following Power Unit elements have been used:
5th Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)
5th Turbo Charger (TC)
5th Motor Generator Unit - Heat (MGU-H)
3rd Energy Store (ES)
3rd Control Electronics (CE)
The following Restricted-Number Components have been used:
5th Gearbox Cases and Cassettes (GBX C & C)
5th Gearbox Driveline, Gear Change Components and Auxiliary Components (GBX

All elements above were replaced without the approval of the FIA Technical Delegate
during Parc Fermé.
InfringementBreaches of Articles 28.2, 29.2, 40.3 and 40.9 of the FIA Formula One Sporting
Regulations.
Decision Required to start the Race from the pit lane.
Reason Reason: The penalty is imposed in accordance with 40.9
The Power Unit elements used are in excess of the permitted number for the 2023
Championship season were used. This is a breach of Art. 28.2 and incurs a grid
penalty.
The RNC components and auxiliary components used are in excess of the permitted
number for the 2023 Championship season were used. This is a breach of Art. 29.2
and incurs a grid penalty.
As the PU elements and RNC and auxiliary components were changed without prior
approval of the Technical Delegate in Parque Fermé this is not in accordance with
Article 40.3 and Art 40.9 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. The
competitor is therefore required to start the race from the pit lane per article 40.9 of
the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
