Scuderia Ferrari
Time 18:46
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 30 & 31)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 16:24
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 55 unnecessarily impeded Car 10 in turn 13.
Infringment Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 5​​ 5 (Carlos Sainz), the driver of Car 1​​ 0
(Pierre Gasly), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, and in-car video evidence.
The driver of Car 55 stated that he was surprised that the driver of Car 22 overtook
him into Turn 13 and as a result he accelerated late to start his fast lap.
The driver of Car 10 stated that the driver of Car 55 could have and should have
“gone earlier”.
Telemetry showed a significant speed differential between Cars 55 and 10.
Although the overtaking move by Car 22 took the driver of Car 55 by surprise, it is our
determination that the driver of Car 55 was predominantly to blame and unnecessarily
impeded Car 10.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
