The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 27 - Nico Hulkenberg
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 20:03
Session Race
Fact Incorrect starting location.
InfringementBreach of Article 48.1 c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video evidence, showing that at the time of the start signal,
Car 27 was in the incorrect grid position. In fact Car 27 took the starting position that
was allocated to Car 55 which was not able to start the race, so he started the race
from P12 instead of P14.
Due to the severity of the infringement compared to precedents in which cars were
out of position by only small margins, a 10 seconds time penalty is imposed.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
