The Power Unit elements used are in excess of the permitted number for the 2023
Championship season were used. This is a breach of Art. 28.2 and incurs a grid
penalty.
As the PU elements were changed without prior approval of the Technical Delegate in

Formula One Sporting Regulations. The competitor is therefore required to start the
race from the pit lane per article 40.9 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.

on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
