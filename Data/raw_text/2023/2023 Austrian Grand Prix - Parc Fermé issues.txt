Set-up parameter changes have been made to car 20, driver Kevin Magnussen, with the approval of

Regulations.
The following driver will use a new energy store (ES) for the remainder of the Competition:
Number Car Driver Previously used ES

The energy store used by Nyck de Vries is the third of the two new energy stores allowed for the
2023 Championship season and this is not in conformity with Article 28.2 of the 2023 Formula One
Sporting Regulations.
The following driver will use a new control electronics (CE) for the remainder of the Competition:

The PU elements have been replaced without the approval of the FIA technical delegate.
The following parts have been replaced during the Parc Fermé yesterday and today by the
AlphaTauri Honda RBPT team for parts with a different specification:
Car 21: Rear wing (different spec)
Beam wing (different spec)
The parts have been replaced with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written
request from the team concerned, this being in accordance with Article 40.3 of the 2023 Formula
One Sporting Regulations.
But as the above parts are different from the ones originally used and also changes have been made
to the set up of the suspension (with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written
request), car number 21 should now be required to start from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 of
the 2023 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
