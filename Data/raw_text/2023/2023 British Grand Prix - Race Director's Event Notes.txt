EVENT NOTES
General Instructions
1) Track light panels
The FIA track light panels have been installed in the positions shown on the circuit map. In
accordance with Appendix H to the ISC the light signals have the same meaning as flag signals.
2) Drivers leaving their pit stop position in the pit lane
For safety reasons, no car should be driven from its pit stop position at any time unless:
a) It has first been driven into the pit stop position having just entered the pit lane from the track,
and;
b) It is then driven immediately back onto the track from the pit stop position.
3) Observing yellow flags
3.1 Single waved: Drivers reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction. It must be clear that
a driver has reduced speed and, in order for this to be clear, a driver would be expected to have
braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant marshalling sector.
3.2 Double waved: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow marshalling sector must reduce
speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop. In order for the stewards to be
satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements it must be clear that he has not
attempted to set a meaningful lap time. Furthermore, during qualifying any driver in a double yellow
sector will have that lap time cancelled.
3.3 Double Waved during VSC or SC: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow marshalling
sector during a VSC or SC, in addition to the requirements in 3.2 above, must remain positive of the
SECU delta time in the sector concerned.
4) Laps during Qualifying and Reconnaissance Laps
4.1 In order to ensure that cars are not driven unnecessarily slowly on in laps during and after the end
of qualifying or during reconnaissance laps when the pit exit is opened for the race, drivers must stay
below the maximum time set by the FIA between the Safety Car lines shown on the pit lane map.
Teams and Drivers will be informed of the maximum time after the second practice session.
5) Article 55.14
“In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the point
at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves no erratic
acceleration or braking nor any manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede the
restart”.

6) Parc Fermé
6.1 The Parc Fermé cameras must be always uncovered and operational during the Event.
6.2 No more than three (3) team personnel per car are permitted into the Parc Fermé area for the sole
purpose of fitting cooling fans and any work required by the FIA.
7) Lapping during the race
The ISC requires drivers who are caught by another car to allow the faster driver past at the first
available opportunity. The F1 Marshalling System has been developed in order to ensure that the
point at which a driver is shown blue flags is consistent, rather than trusting the ability of marshals
to identify situations that require blue flags.
The system will be set to give a pre-warning when the faster car is within 3.0s of the car about to
be lapped, this should be used by the team of the slower car to warn their driver he is soon going
to be lapped and that allowing the faster car through should be considered a priority. When the
faster car is within 1.2s of the car about to be lapped blue flags will be shown to the slower car (in
addition to blue light panels, blue cockpit lights and a message on the timing monitors) and the
driver must allow the following driver to overtake at the first available opportunity.
It should be noted that the aim of using F1MS is ensure consistent application of the rules,
additional instructions may also be given by race control when necessary.
8) Article 19.4
In accordance with the provisions of Article 19.4 a), upon request by the Technical Delegate, the
Teams are required to connect the umbilical to the cars and close the HV contactors (TR 5.26.5)
for the sole purpose of checking the car ERS safety status, every morning immediately after the
covers are removed and the cars are under parc fermé conditions. The umbilical must then remain
connected, and the car powered up until the end of the pre-race car display period.
Event Specific Instructions
9) Formula 1 Sporting Regulations Article 23.1

preceding the start of the Qualifying session and if there are support competitions using the pit lane.
11) Specific Technical Procedures

active Appendix documents, Technical and Sporting Directives. The latest version of this Index file

13) Positioning of the car on track during Free Practice and Qualifying
To help mitigate any differences in speed, cars on out or slow laps are requested to stay clearly
offline where possible between Turns 14 and 16.
14) Practice starts

14.2 For reasons of safety and sporting equity, cars may not stop in the fast lane at any time the pit exit
is open without a justifiable reason.
14.3 Additionally, practice starts may be carried out on the track at the end of each free practice session.
Any car on the track when the chequered flag is shown may then complete another lap and, instead
of entering the pits, proceed to the grid and carry out a practice start.
14.4 All drivers carrying out a practice start must do so by pulling as far forward on the grid as possible
and, if necessary, should wait for others to carry out a start before getting to a grid position further
forward. Under no circumstances should a driver make a practice start if another car is still stationary
in front of him on the same side of the grid.

possibility to carry out any further starts will be immediately terminated.

17) Track Limits

Indicated by white boards with a red fire extinguisher image attached to the debris fences.
19) Places to remove cars from the track
Indicated by fluorescent orange panels/paintings on the barriers.
