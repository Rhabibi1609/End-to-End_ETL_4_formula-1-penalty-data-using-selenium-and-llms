To The Team Manager, Date 01 April 2023
McLaren F1 Team
Time 14:33
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 25) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren F1 Team
Time 13:31
Session Practice 3
Fact Failure to follow Race Director’s instructions.
Offence Breach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Director’s Event Note (item 17.3, document 22).
Decision Reprimand (Driving)
This is the driver’s 1st reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 8​​ 1 (Oscar Piastri), the team
representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing,
telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that there was a
failure to follow item 17.3 of the Race Director’s Event Notes in relation to Practice
Starts.
The driver admitted that he had lost concentration and was preparing to do a practice
start but attempted it a lap too early, having failed to take the chequered flag before
doing so.
After he slowed down considerably, the team warned him to complete the lap before
attempting a practice start and therefore he did not go through the full practice start
procedure. The driver candidly admitted his mistake and recognised that this could
have resulted in a dangerous situation on the track.
In accordance with previous precedents for similar infringements, we imposed a
reprimand on him.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
