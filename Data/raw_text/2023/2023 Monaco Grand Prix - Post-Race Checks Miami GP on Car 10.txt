After the race in Miami, car number 10 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more
extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the ICE air intake system, the heat exchangers as well as
all attached sensors, their loom routing and connections to the SECU and other units. Further the
legality documents for these components were checked
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2023 Formula One Technical
