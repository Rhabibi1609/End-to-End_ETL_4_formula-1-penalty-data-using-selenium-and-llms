Time 18:52
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 17:00
Session Race
Fact Causing a collision
Offence Breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 2 for the 12 month period)
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that on the first corner of the
restart, a collision occurred between Car 55 and Car 14. We determined that Car 55
was wholly to blame for the collision.
Car 14 was significantly ahead of Car 55 at the first corner and nevertheless Car 55
drove into Car 14, causing it to spin and leave the track. We accordingly imposed a
5-second penalty on Car 55.
For avoidance of doubt, we took into account the fact that this collision took place at
the first lap of the restart, when, by convention, the Stewards would typically take a
more lenient view of incidents.
However, in this particular case, notwithstanding the fact that it was the equivalent of
a first lap incident, we considered that there was sufficient gap for Car 55 to take
steps to avoid the collision and failed to do so.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
