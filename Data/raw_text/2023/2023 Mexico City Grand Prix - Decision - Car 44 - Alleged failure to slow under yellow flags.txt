The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 28) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton
Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team
Time 15:17
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 44 appeared to fail to comply with a yellow flag in turn 3.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio
and in-car video evidence.
The on board video clearly shows there is no light or flag displayed to Car 44 on the
straight into Turn 1, then a green light shows as he enters Turn 2, which is followed by
2 pulses of a yellow light then moments later, the light panel is blank. The driver was
slightly slower in the mini sector than on his previous push lap.
Our determination is that there was no breach of the regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
