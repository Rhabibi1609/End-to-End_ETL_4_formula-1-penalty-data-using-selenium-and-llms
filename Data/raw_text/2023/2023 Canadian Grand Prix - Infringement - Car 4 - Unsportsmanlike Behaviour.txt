The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren F1 Team
Time 14:19
Session Race
Fact The driver slowed under the Safety Car to avoid a delay during a “double stack” for
his pitstop.
Infringment Breach of Article 12.2.1.l of the of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence.
During the Safety Car period the driver slowed to allow a gap to form between his
team mate in Car 81 and him. In doing so he delayed the cars behind. There was a
significant difference in speed between Car 4 and Car 81 between Turns 10 and 13
(approximately 50 km/h).
Article 12.2.1.l of the ISC refers to “any infringement of the principles of fairness in
competition, behaviour in an unsportsmanlike manner or attempt to influence the
results of a competition, in a way that is contrary to sporting ethics”.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
