To All Officials, All Teams Date 30 April 2023
Time 18:45
The Stewards, having received a report from the FIA Sporting Delegate and the Race Director,
having examined video evidence, summoned and heard representatives of the FIA, have
considered the following matter, and determine the following:
Time 16:36
Session Race
Fact Persons blocking the fast lane in the pit lane on the final lap of the 2023 Azerbaijan
Grand Prix while the pit lane remained open (Article 12.2.1.h and
Article 12.3.1 of the International Sporting Code)
Reasoned Decision
The Stewards heard from the FIA representatives and determined that the relevant
representatives took steps to set up the parc ferme area and also permitted media and other
personnel to gather in the start of the pit lane and the pit wall during the last lap of the race, while
the pit lane was open and before the final pit stop of OCO (Car 31).
We noted that it was not unusual for the representatives to allow such persons into the pit lane
just before the end of the race, in the usual course of preparation for parc ferme and the Podium
ceremony. However, in this case, there was one driver that had to pit in the last lap and this
created a very dangerous situation for those that were in the pit lane at the time. We considered
that it was fortunate that there were no serious consequences on account of what happened
today. We stressed that the requirements of ensuring a safe and orderly event are paramount.
This was acknowledged by the FIA team.
We walked through the relevant procedures and protocol with the FIA representatives in detail
and required them to take immediate steps to reconsider these procedures and protocols with
the relevant stakeholders (including FOM, the teams and the FIA) to ensure that this situation
does not occur again.
The FIA representatives expressed their regret at what happened and assured us that they
would do so in time for the next event.
