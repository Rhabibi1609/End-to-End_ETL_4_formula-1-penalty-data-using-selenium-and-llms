Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 4.2, document 16)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras. Most of the incidents were easily judged
based on the video evidence and therefore there was no necessity to hear from
the drivers involved. For one incident, the Stewards summoned (document 23)
and heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton) and the team representative
to obtain more clarity.
All drivers concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:46.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, in all six cases the Stewards
determined that the drivers took appropriate actions to not impede other drivers,
and in all cases they slowed down significantly to allow other drivers to pass while
giving those drivers a clear track. The Stewards therefore determine that they did
not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and that evidently the reason they were above the
maximum time was due to their appropriate actions and take no further action.
However, the Stewards noted that in most of the incidents the fact that other cars
were making a gap at the end of the lap influenced the drivers trying to maintain
their delta time. The drivers are reminded once again that no car may be driven
unnecessarily slowly and the Stewards will continue to monitor the issue closely.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
