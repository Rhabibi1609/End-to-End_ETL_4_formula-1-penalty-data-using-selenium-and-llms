Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the McLaren Formula 1 Team, who are associated with the operation
of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the twelve and a half hour period which
commenced at 21:00 on 26 May, fifteen and a half hours before the scheduled start time of P3 and
ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 09:30 on 27 May.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the McLaren Formula 1 Team during
the 2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
