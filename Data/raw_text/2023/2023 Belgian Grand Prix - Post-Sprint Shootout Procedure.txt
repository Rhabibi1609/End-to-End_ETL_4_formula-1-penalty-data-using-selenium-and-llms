NOTE TO TEAMS: POST SPRINT SHOOTOUT INTERVIEW PROCEDURE
The Post-Sprint Shootout procedure requires the fastest driver to be interviewed once they have got out
of their car. We would like to ask for your co-operation in ensuring the procedure below is followed:
• If they take the chequered flag at the end of SQ3, the fastest three (3) drivers should return to the Pit
Lane where they will find the boards from 1,2,3 in front of the FIA Garages.
• Other than the team mechanics (with cooling fans if necessary), officials and FIA pre-approved
television crews and the four (4) FIA approved photographers, no one else will be allowed in this
designated area at this time (no driver physios nor team PR personnel). At the sole discretion of
the FIA Media Delegate, the team-embedded photographer of the pole position driver may also be
permitted in the Parc Fermé area at this time.
• Once out of their cars, the top three (3) Drivers will be weighed by the FIA. Each Driver must remain
fully attired until after they have been weighed (e.g: Helmet, Gloves, etc).
• After the Drivers have been weighed, the Post-Sprint Shootout interview with the fastest driver only will
take place in this designated area. The interviewer will be selected by the Commercial Rights Holder.
• If the fastest driver is in the Pit Lane at the end of the session, the team should ensure that they go
directly to the designated area once the other drivers have arrived there.
• At the end of the live interviews the fastest driver will be led to the backdrop for a Pirelli Award photo
opportunity.
• The top three (3) drivers will then conduct a pooled TV interview at the back of the FIA Garages. There
will be no Press Conference following the Sprint Shootout.
• Drivers eliminated in SQ1 and SQ2, drivers classified from 4th to 10th in SQ3 and drivers who did not
participate in SQ1 but are eligible to race must conduct a pooled TV interview immediately after they
have been weighed by the FIA at the end of the last part of the Sprint Shootout in which they
participated. This will take place directly behind the FIA garage.
Please see the attached Sprint Shootout - Parc Fermé Diagram.
