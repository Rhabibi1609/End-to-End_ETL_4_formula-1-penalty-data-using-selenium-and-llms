permission for car 2, Logan Sargeant, to start the Race, as the driver has set satisfactory times in

Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in
accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial
