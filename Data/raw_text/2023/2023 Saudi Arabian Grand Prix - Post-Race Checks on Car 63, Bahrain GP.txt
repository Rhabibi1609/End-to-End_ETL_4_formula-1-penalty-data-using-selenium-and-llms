Technical Delegate’s Report
After the race of the Bahrain GP, car number 63 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for
more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were driver’s clutch paddles and accelerator pedal as well as
all attached sensors, their loom routing and connections to the SECU and other units.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2023 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
