Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 4.2, document 16)
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras for every incident.
All drivers concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:56.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, in all cases the Stewards
determined that the drivers took appropriate actions to not impede other drivers,
and in all cases they either slowed down significantly to allow other drivers to pass
while giving those drivers a clear track or otherwise drove in a sensible manner to
avoid any potentially dangerous incidents on track. The Stewards therefore
determine that all drivers concerned did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and that
evidently the reason they were above the maximum time was due to their
appropriate actions and take no further action.
The Stewards note that the intention of the delta time regulation is to reduce the
chance of dangerous impeding incidents on track. This intention is taken into
account when investigating such incidents and the Stewards acknowledge that the
regulation is working well for this purpose. However, all teams and drivers are
reminded that the latitude extended in these particular incidents cannot be used as
a general excuse for not complying with the delta time requirement.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
