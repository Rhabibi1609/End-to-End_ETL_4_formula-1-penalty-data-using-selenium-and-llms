The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 17:14
Session Sprint
Fact Car 23 allegedly left the track at T1 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 c) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, timing, telemetry in-car video evidence.
Car 81 attempted a very late move on Car 23 up the inside into Turn 1, forcing Car
23 off track at the exit. Due to the track layout in that part of the track, Car 23 was
able to stay alongside and maintain his position, essentially resulting in both cars
ending up in the correct order. Taking all this into account the Stewards decide to take
no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
