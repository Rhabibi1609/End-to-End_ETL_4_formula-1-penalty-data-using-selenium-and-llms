Session Race
Fact Failure to properly serve a penalty during a pit stop.
Offence Breach of Article 54.4 c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video evidence. Car 31 came into the pit lane and stopped to
serve a 5 second time penalty. After 4.6 seconds a mechanic started working on the
car. This is a breach of the regulations, however not significant enough to warrant
disqualification.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
