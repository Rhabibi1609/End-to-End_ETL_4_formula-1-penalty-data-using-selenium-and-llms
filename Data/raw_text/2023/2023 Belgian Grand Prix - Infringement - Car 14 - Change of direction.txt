Time 19:28
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 14 - Fernando Alonso
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 17:53
Session Sprint
Fact Car 14 changed direction causing Car 27 to take avoiding action between Turn 1 and
Turn 2 at 17:53.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 e) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Warning.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 4 (Fernando Alonso), the driver of Car
27 (Nico Hulkenberg), team representatives and reviewed video and in-car video
evidence.
Alonso was exiting the pits and moved over to the left, causing car 27 to have to take
action to avoid a collision. Alonso explained that he had no visibility to the rear at the
time, and that he had driven on the far left of the track at that location on every lap in
order to maximize his forward visibility. While the Stewards accept these facts, the
move from the right to the left in this case, while slower than the cars that had
remained on track, caused the potential for a collision. Considering the conditions in
mitigation, the Stewards issue a Warning.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
