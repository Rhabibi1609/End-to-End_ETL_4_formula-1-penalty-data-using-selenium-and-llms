2023 HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX
21 - 23 July 2023
From The FIA Formula One Technical Delegate Document 21

Technical Delegate’s Report
As the P1 session was declared wet, one (1) additional set of intermediate tyres were made
available to all drivers who used a set of intermediate tyres during the P1 session. Under these
circumstances, Article 30.5 g) of the Sporting Regulations states that one (1) used set of
intermediate tyres must be electronically returned before the start of the qualifying session.
Car 20 and Car 27 both used a set of intermediate tyres in the P1 session:
Car 20 Intermediate tyres used in P1 – Set 20-701
Car 27 Intermediate tyres used in P1 – Set 27-701
The MoneyGram Haas F1 Team were subsequently issued with one (1) additional set of
intermediate tyres for both Cars 20 and 27.
The MoneyGram Haas F1 Team has not electronically returned one (1) used set of intermediate
tyres for both Cars 20 and 27 before the start of the qualifying session, this is not in accordance
with Article 30.5 g) of the Sporting Regulations. Therefore, I am referring this matter to the stewards
for their consideration.
It should be noted that the used intermediate tyres in question have been physically returned to the
tyre supplier.
