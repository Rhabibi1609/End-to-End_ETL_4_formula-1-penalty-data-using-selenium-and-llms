Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the MoneyGram Haas F1 Team and the Williams Racing team, who
are associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the ten and
a half hour period which commenced at 23:00 on 02 June, thirteen and a half hours before the
scheduled start time of P3 and ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 09:30 on
03 June.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the MoneyGram Haas F1 Team and
the Williams Racing team during the 2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no
action should be taken.
