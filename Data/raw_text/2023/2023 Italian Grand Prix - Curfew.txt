Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Formula One Team, who are
associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the eleven and
a half hour period which commenced at 22:00 on 01 September, fourteen and a half hours
before the scheduled start time of P3 and ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at
09:30 on 02 September.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant
Formula One Team during the 2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action
should be taken.
