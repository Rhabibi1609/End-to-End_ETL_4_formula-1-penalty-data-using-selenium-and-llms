Time 23:48
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 45, 46 &
48) and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 20:52
Session Sprint
Fact Turn 2 incident between Cars 11, 27 and 31 at 20:52.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 1 (Sergio Perez), the driver of Car 2​​ 7
(Nico Hulkenberg), the driver of Car 3​​ 1 (Esteban Ocon), team representatives and
reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Cars 27 and 31 were fighting for position into Turn 1 and therefore had a slower exit
out of Turn 1. This led to Car 11 being able to pull alongside on the outside before
Turn 2. The cars entered Turn 2 three-wide, collided and spun off track.
Whilst Car 31 was moving from the left track edge to the middle of the track between
Turns 1 and 2 with Car 27 on his right, the driver was not aware of Car 11 pulling
alongside on the right side as his visibility was blocked by Car 27. The Stewards
determine that Car 31 moved in a manner that would have allowed Cars 31 and 27 to
negotiate Turn 2 side by side if Car 11 had not been there. Taking all this into
account, the Stewards conclude that no driver was wholly or predominantly at fault for
the collision. The incident is considered as a race incident and no further action is
taken.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
