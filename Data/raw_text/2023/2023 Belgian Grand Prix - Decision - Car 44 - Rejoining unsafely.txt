Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the driver of Car 63
(George Russell), the team representative and reviewed video, team radio and in-car
video evidence.
Hamilton explained that he had been warned of the approach of Bottas and moved
out of the way, in this case off track. Russell explained that he had the same warning
but moved out of the way later. He also explained that as he was on the same
program as Hamilton he was fully aware of what Hamilton was doing and that at no
point was the manoeuvre unsafe. The Stewards agree and take no further action.

Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
