The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 2 - Logan Sargeant
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 21:04
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 2 unnecessarily impeding Car 18 in turn 8 at 21:04.
InfringementBreach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving) on the Driver.
This is the driver’s 1st reprimand of the season.
The competitor Williams Racing is fined €5,000
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2​​ (Logan Sargeant), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, and team radio evidence.
Car 2 clearly impeded Car 18 at Turn 8. However in mitigation of penalty for the
driver, the Stewards considered the fact that the team made no radio communication
to warn him of the approach of Car 18. It is essential, especially in Qualification,
drivers be given sufficient and accurate warning of the approach of another vehicle.
Accordingly and consistent with previous decisions, a fine is imposed on the
Competitor, who admitted that it had failed to provide an appropriate warning.
It is noted that the Team Representative of Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
was not present at the time of the hearing but did attend the Stewards' Room after the
Hearing had finished.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
