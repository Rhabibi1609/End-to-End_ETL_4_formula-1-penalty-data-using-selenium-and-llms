Technical Delegate’s Report
After the race in São Paulo, car number 04 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more
extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the accelerator pedal including all attached sensors, their
loom routing and connections to the SECU and other units; the rear wing tethers and the rear impact
structure tether.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2023 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
