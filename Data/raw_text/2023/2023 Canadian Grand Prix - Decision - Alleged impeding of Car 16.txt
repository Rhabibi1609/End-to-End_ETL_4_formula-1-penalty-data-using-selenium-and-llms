To The Team Manager, Date 17 June 2023
Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 19:47
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 16:14
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 22 appeared to impede Car 16 in turn 13.
Infringment Alleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2​​ 2 (Yuki Tsunoda), the driver of Car 1​​ 6
(Charles Leclerc), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence.
Car 22 was slowed by Car 2 in the area of Turn 10 and as a result aborted his push
lap partway down the straight between Turns 12 and 13. Meanwhile Car 16 was on a
push lap closing rapidly.
The driver of Car 16 stated that he backed off “as a precaution” and conceded that
this was a difficult situation for the team of Car 22 to manage, in the short distance
prior to Turn 13. Accordingly we determine that Car 22 did not unnecessarily impede
Car 16.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
