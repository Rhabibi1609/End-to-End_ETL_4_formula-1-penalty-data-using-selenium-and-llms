The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 45 & 46)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 21:44
Session Race
Fact Turn 13 incident between Cars 11 and 23 at 21:44.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
1 penalty point (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 1 (Sergio Perez), the driver of Car 2​​ 3
(Alexander Albon), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video and in-car video evidence.
At the approach to Turn 13 Car 23 was in front, with Car 40 in front of both of them
and travelling slower. Car 23 attempted to take the normal racing line through Turn 13
and was not aware of the exact location of Car 11. Car 11 make a move down the
inside of Car 23 and in doing so collided with Car 23.
The stewards considered that this was an “optimistic” late manoeuvre by the driver of
Car 11, that it could be defined as “diving in”, and that there was nothing that the
driver of Car 23 could have done to avoid the collision. Accordingly it is determined
that the driver of Car 11 was predominantly to blame.
We note the presence of the slower Car 40 in front of Car 23 caused the driver of
Car 11 to believe he could make the overtake and therefore in mitigation of penalty,
we determined to allocate only one penalty point.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
