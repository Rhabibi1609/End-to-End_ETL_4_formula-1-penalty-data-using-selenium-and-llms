From The Stewards Document 45
To The Team Manager, Date 26 August 2023
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 18:50
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 36 & 37)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 15:10
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 18 allegedly unnecessarily impeded Car 44 in turn 13 at 15:10
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 8 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 4​​ 4
(Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, team radio and in-car video evidence.
Stroll was on a prep lap and Hamilton was on a fast lap both approaching Turn 13.
The stewards observed that Stroll had stayed out of the way of several cars from
Turn 10 through Turn 12. He then started accelerating for the next lap early enough
that he should have not impeded Hamilton. His speed at the apex of Turn 13 was
similar to fast cars at that point. However, at the exit of Turn 13 he had not gained
enough momentum and affected Hamilton’s lap.
In the opinion of the stewards, while Hamilton was impeded, Stroll’s behaviour did not
rise to the level of “unnecessarily impeding” as specified in the Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
