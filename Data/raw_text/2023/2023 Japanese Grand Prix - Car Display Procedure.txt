NOTE TO TEAMS: CAR DISPLAY PROCEDURES
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations, please
note the following procedures for the Car Display at this Competition:
• Between 10:00 and 11:00 on Friday, one car from each team must be positioned in the same
way as last season, with the other car positioned and available for viewing inside your garage. If
only one car will carry the major aerodynamic and bodywork components and assemblies that
have not been run at a previous Competition or TCC and are intended to be run at the
Competition, this car must be the one displayed to media.
• The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking place the
car must return to the same position.
• At any Competition where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the
cars in position and use your grid easy ups.
• There must be enough space around the entire car on display to allow people to move
safely and unhindered.
• The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid overlapping of
any presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to hold (any presentations are not
mandatory for the Pre-Event Display) – media and broadcasters are not required to follow
the below timings unless the team is arranging a presentation or Q&A at these times:
Time Team
10:00 - 10:06 Red Bull Racing
10:06 - 10:12 Ferrari
10:12 - 10:18 Mercedes
10:18 - 10:24 Alpine
10:24 - 10:30 McLaren
10:30 - 10:36 Alfa Romeo

10:42 - 10:48 Haas
10:48 - 10:54 AlphaTauri
10:54 - 11:00 Williams

• Teams may conduct additional interviews and discussions outside of these times should they
wish, but it is highly recommended that these times are used by all teams to maximise efficiency.
• After Qualifying, three cars for the presentation will be selected for display at this Competition,
which will take place on Sunday commencing five hours before the scheduled start of the
formation lap. This selection will be communicated to the teams by the FIA Technical Delegate
after Qualifying.
• The Post-Qualifying presentations will take place in the pit lane or team garages depending upon
activities taking place in the pit lane at the below timings:
o 09:05
o 09:20
o 09:35
• Each team that is selected must have the technical representative indicated previously to the FIA
available at these times.
