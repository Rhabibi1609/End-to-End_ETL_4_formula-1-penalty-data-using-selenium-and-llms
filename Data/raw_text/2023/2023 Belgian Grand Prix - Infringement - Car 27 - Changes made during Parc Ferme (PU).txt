InfringementBreaches of Articles 28.2, 29.2, 40.3 and 40.9 of the FIA Formula One Sporting
Regulations.
Decision Required to start the Race from the pit lane.
Reason The penalty is imposed in accordance with 40.9
Power Unit elements in excess of the permitted number for the 2023 Championship
season were used. This is a breach of Article 28.2 and incurs a grid penalty.
RNC components and auxiliary components in excess of the permitted number for
the 2023 Championship season were used. This is a breach of Article 29.2 and
incurs a grid penalty.
As the PU elements and RNC and auxiliary components were changed without prior
approval of the Technical Delegate in Parc Fermé this is not in accordance with
Article 40.3 and Article 40.9 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. The
competitor is therefore required to start the race from the pit lane per Article 40.9 of
the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
