Time 17:12
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 13:17
Session Reconnaissance Laps
Fact Car 18 did not enter the Pit Lane after completing its reconnaissance laps despite
being a Pit Lane starter.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 44 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video evidence.
After completing his reconnaissance laps, the driver of Car 18 did not proceed to the
pit lane directly, but missed the pit entry and continued on track until he arrived at the
end of the starting grid despite being required to start the race from the pit lane. The
car was then pushed back to the pits by the team on skates.
The Stewards note that the scenario caused by the incident was far from ideal.
However, having reviewed the matter in detail, although the established process was
not followed, no breach of any regulation was evident.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
