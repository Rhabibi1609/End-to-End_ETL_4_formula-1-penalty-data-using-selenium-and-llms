The Stewards have received a request from Williams Racing to allow Car 2 to start the Sprint
despite failing to set a Sprint Shootout time within 107% of the fastest time set in SQ1.
In accordance with Article 39.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations, the Stewards grant
permission for Car 2, Logan Sargeant, to start the Sprint, as the driver has set satisfactory times in
practice at this Event. The car will be placed on the grid in accordance with Article 42.2 of the FIA
Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in
accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial
and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant
regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
