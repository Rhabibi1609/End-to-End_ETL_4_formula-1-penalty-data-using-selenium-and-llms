The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 14:27
Session Race
Fact Turn 11 incident between Cars 11 and 20.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 7 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed track and in-car video evidence.
PER was trying to overtake MAG on the inside of turn 11. The Stewards determine
that PER was predominately to blame for the collision. Applying the 2023 Driving
Standards Guidelines for overtaking at the inside of a corner, the Stewards noted that
there was no significant portion of car 11 alongside car 20 and therefore determined
that car 11 was not entitled to racing room in turn 11. PER did not manage to do the
overtaking manoeuvre in a safe and controlled manner.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
