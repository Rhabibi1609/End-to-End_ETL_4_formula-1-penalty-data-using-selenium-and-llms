From The Stewards Document 47
To The Team Manager, Date 04 November 2023
BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 14:38
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 39 & 40)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 31 - Esteban Ocon
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 11:11
Session Sprint Shootout
Fact Turn 3 incident between Cars 14 and 31 at 11:11.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 14 (Fernando Alonso), the driver of Car
31 (Esteban Ocon), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling
system data, video, team radio and in-car video evidence.
The Stewards determined that ALO was aware that OCO was approaching at high
speed on the exit of turn 2. Thus, ALO moved off of the racing line so that OCO could
pass. At turn 3, OCO lost the balance of the car and went wide on the exit. At the
same time, ALO turned more towards the racing line giving less room for OCO. The
combination of these two elements lead to the collision.
The Stewards determined that no driver was wholly or predominantly to blame.
Therefore, no penalty is applied.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
