Session Race
Fact Causing a collision
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 4 for 12-month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence and determined that Car 24 failed to slow down and brake in time and
collided with Car 3 at the start of the race, just before Turn 1. The resulting collision
caused a chain reaction upfront.
Although this was a lap one incident, where some leeway is given to the drivers who
get caught up in the middle of a number of cars, this particular incident was not one of
those. Here, Car 24 got off to a slow start and simply did not slow down enough when
approaching the corner, resulting in an unnecessary collision. We therefore imposed
a 5 second penalty with two penalty points on Car 24.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
