the operation of tyres during the following event.
Document version 3 Issue B
Grand Prix of Spain 02/06-04/06/2023 (23R08BCN)
Compounds selection
Prescriptions
Pressures & camber
Cold Pressure Cooling Curve
Pfront = (T - 70) ∙ 0.117 + Pstartf
Prear = (T - 70) ∙ 0.109+ Pstartr
Pstartf: Minimum starting pressure on
the front axle [psi]
Pstartr: Minimum starting pressure on
the rear axle [psi]
T: Tyre temperature [°C]
Maximum heating times and temperatures (tread & sidewall)
Tyres notes
• Not permitted to switch tyres from their originally allocated position. • Heating time temperature limits apply to the actual tyre surface
temperature measured with the IR gun as detailed in the TD003
• Do not subject tyres to large deformation or heavy impact.
• Cold cooling curve temperature limits apply to the tyre side wall
• Do not leave fitted tyres exposed at an air temperature lower than 10°C temperature measured with the probe as detailed in TD003
and/or any excessive UV emission.
• BLANKET HEATING TIME for each temperature range to be counted from
• Revised prescriptions could be issued during the race weekend in the moment the blanket control unit is set to reach its targeted temperature
accordance with TD003. within its correspondent interval.
General notes
Teams are kindly reminded that the following will be subject to FIA checks during the event:
• Starting pressures
• Cold pressures (according to the cold pressure cooling curves)
• Re-heat pressures
• EOS Camber
• Maximum tyre temperatures and times in blankets
• Tyre swapping
