From The Stewards Document 47
To The Team Manager, Date 17 June 2023
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 20:16
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 36 & 37)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 16:42
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 18 unnecessarily impeded Car 31 in turn 8.
Infringment Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1​​ 8 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 3​​ 1
(Esteban Ocon), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence.
The driver of Car 18 stated that although he was aware of Car 31 approaching, he
had no choice but to remain on the dry racing line because his tyres (soft compound)
were cold and if he had not, he would have crashed due to the wet nature of the track.
However the team did make him aware of the closeness of Car 31 and it is our view
that he could have reduced speed on the straight between Turns 7 and 8 and allowed
Car 31 past. Because of this, he unnecessarily impeded Car 31
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
