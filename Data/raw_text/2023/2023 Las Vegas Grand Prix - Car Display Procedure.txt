NOTE TO TEAMS: CAR DISPLAY PROCEDURES
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations, please
note the following procedures for the Car Display at this Competition:
• Between 19:00 and 20:00 on Thursday, one car from each team must be positioned in the same
way as previous events, with the other car positioned and available for viewing inside your
garage. If only one car will carry the major aerodynamic and bodywork components and
assemblies that have not been run at a previous Competition or TCC and are intended to be run
at the Competition, this car must be the one displayed to media.
• The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking place the
car must return to the same position.
• At any Competition where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the
cars in position and use your grid easy ups.
• There must be enough space around the entire car on display to allow people to move
safely and unhindered – for the avoidance of doubt, this means that any team equipment /
infrastructure must not be positioned within 2m of the cars.
• The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid overlapping of
any presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to hold (any presentations are not
mandatory for the Pre-Event Display) – media and broadcasters are not required to follow
the below timings unless the team is arranging a presentation or Q&A at these times:
Time Team
19:00 - 19:06 Red Bull Racing
19:06 - 19:12 Ferrari
19:12 - 19:18 Mercedes
19:18 - 19:24 Alpine
19:24 - 19:30 McLaren
19:30 - 19:36 Alfa Romeo
19:36 - 19:42 Aston Martin
19:42 - 19:48 Haas
19:48 - 19:54 AlphaTauri
19:54 - 20:00 Williams

• Teams may conduct additional interviews and discussions outside of these times should they
wish, but it is highly recommended that these times are used by all teams to maximise efficiency.
• After Qualifying, three cars for the presentation will be selected for display at this Competition,
which will take place on Saturday commencing five hours before the scheduled start of the
formation lap. This selection will be communicated to the teams by the FIA Technical Delegate
after Qualifying.
• The Post-Qualifying presentations will take place in the pit lane or team garages depending upon
activities taking place in the pit lane at the below timings:
o 17:05
o 17:20
o 17:35
• Each team that is selected must have the technical representative indicated previously to the FIA
available at these times.
