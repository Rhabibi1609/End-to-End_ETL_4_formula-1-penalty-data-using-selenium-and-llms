heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine

Fact Leaving the track and rejoining unsafely at the exit of T8 at 17:28.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 c) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision Reprimand (Driving).
This is the driver’s 1st reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 23 (Alexander Albon), the team
representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car
video evidence.
Albon left the circuit at Turn 8 at the end of Q1. He then rejoined the circuit on the
racing line. While he was always going to have to rejoin on the line, the Stewards feel
that he could have done more to ensure that he rejoined safely while another car was
approaching.

Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
