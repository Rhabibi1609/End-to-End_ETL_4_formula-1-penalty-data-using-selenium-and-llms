NOTE TO TEAMS: CAR DISPLAY PROCEDURES
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations, please
note the following procedures for the Car Display at this Competition:
Between 12:00 and 13:00 on Friday, one car from each team must be positioned in the same way as
previous events, with the other car positioned and available for viewing inside your garage. If only one
car will carry the major aerodynamic and bodywork components and assemblies that have not been run
at a previous Competition or TCC and are intended to be run at the Competition, this car must be the
one displayed to media.
The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking place the car
must return to the same position.
At any Competition where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the cars in
position and use your grid easy ups.
There must be enough space around the entire car on display to allow people to move safely and
unhindered – for the avoidance of doubt, this means that any team equipment / infrastructure
must not be positioned within 2m of the cars.
The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid overlapping of any
presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to hold (any presentations are not mandatory for the
Pre-Event Display) – media and broadcasters are not required to follow the below timings unless
the team is arranging a presentation or Q&A at these times:
Time Team
12:00 - 12:06 Red Bull Racing
12:06 - 12:12 Ferrari
12:12 - 12:18 Mercedes
12:18 - 12:24 Alpine
12:24 - 12:30 McLaren
12:30 - 12:36 Alfa Romeo
12:36 - 12:42 Aston Martin
12:42 - 12:48 Haas
12:48 - 12:54 AlphaTauri
12:54 - 13:00 Williams
1
Teams may conduct additional interviews and discussions outside of these times should they wish, but it
is highly recommended that these times are used by all teams to maximise efficiency.
After Qualifying, three cars for the presentation will be selected for display at this Competition, which will
take place on Sunday commencing five hours before the scheduled start of the formation lap. This
selection will be communicated to the teams by the FIA Technical Delegate after Qualifying.
The Post-Qualifying presentations will take place in the pit lane or team garages depending upon
activities taking place in the pit lane at the below timings:
12:05
12:20
12:35
Each team that is selected must have the technical representative indicated previously to the FIA
available at these times.
