Session Race
Fact Car 81 left the track at T5 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 c) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, CCTV video, marshalling / positioning data, in-car
video evidence.
Piastri missed the corner at turn 1 and rejoined after turn 2 having gained an
advantage against Lawson. Piastri gave the position back at turn 3 then tried again to
overtake Lawson at turn 4. However, Piastri was not ahead at the apex and thus, in
the opinion of the stewards, did not have the right to the line at turn 5, the second part
of the chicane. He left the track at turn 5 and gained the position over Lawson and did
not subsequently give it back, thus leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
