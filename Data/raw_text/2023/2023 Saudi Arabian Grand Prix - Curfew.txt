Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the BWT Alpine F1 Team team, who are associated with the operation
of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the twelve and a half hour period which
commenced at 01:00 on 18 March, fifteen and a half hours before the scheduled start time
of P3 and ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 13:30 on 18 March.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the BWT Alpine F1 Team team during
the 2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
