Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night the Oracle Red Bull Racing team worked on car number 11, chassis 02, two hours after
chequered flag of the Sprint. Chassis 01 got damaged beyond repair during the accident in the
Sprint. Chassis 01 and all other components fitted to it at the time of the Sprint were covered on time
at 23:08, two hours after chequered flag was shown at the end of the Sprint.
As chassis 02 was assembled without supervision to more than an assembly comprising a survival
cell as defined in SR Article 27.2, this has to be considered as a third car available to the competitor.
A self-declared scrutineering sheet for car 11, chassis 02, was submitted at 14:05 today, 55 minutes
before the covers-off time.
As this is not in compliance with SR Articles 27.2 , 40.3 and 40.6 as well as TD021 G, I am referring
this matter to the Stewards for their consideration.
