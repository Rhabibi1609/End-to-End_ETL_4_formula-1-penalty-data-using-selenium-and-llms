From The Stewards Document 22
To The Team Manager, Date 25 August 2023
MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 18:16
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 17 & 18)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 27 - Nico Hulkenberg
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 16:05
Session Practice 2
Fact Car 27 allegedly unnecessarily impeding Car 1 in turn 12 at 16:05.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 27 (Nico Hulkenberg), the driver of Car 1
(Max Verstappen), team representatives and reviewed video, telemetry and in-car
video evidence.
The drivers agreed that Hulkenberg was affected by the cars in front of him and
slowed, thereby impeding Verstappen. However, as this was FP2, the drivers agreed
that it did not rise to the standard of “Unnecessarily Impeding”. Further, as the closing
speeds at this location are significant, the incident looked more dramatic than what it
was, but the drivers agreed that it was not particularly dangerous.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
