Time 19:40
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 17:38
Session Sprint
Fact Release of Car 22 in an unsafe condition during the Sprint.
Offence Breach of Article 34.14 d) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Scuderia AlphaTauri) is fined €5,000.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda) and a team
representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, team
radio and in-car video evidence and determined that the team released Car 22 in an
unsafe condition. Car 22 had entered the pits after a shunt at Turn 13 of Lap 1 where
the right rear tyre had come off and the rim was touching the track. The driver had
indicated to the team while returning to the pits that the shunt was significant and that
he did not think it was possible to continue.
The team apparently did a visual check on the car, refitted a new tyre and rim and
released the car. The right rear suspension failed almost immediately after the
release and the car had to be driven slowly back to the pits and retired.
We considered that the team could have done more to check if the car was safe
before releasing it. The team representative acknowledged that more could have
been done.
In the circumstances, we imposed a €5,000 fine on the team.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
