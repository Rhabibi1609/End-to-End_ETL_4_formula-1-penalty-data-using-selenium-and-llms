The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 35) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
Session Sprint Shootout
Fact The car below exceeded the 1:46.0 time limit between the Safety Car lines.
No Car Driver Competitor Time of Day Lap
1 10 Pierre Gasly BWT Alpine F1 Team 16:47:40 11 (SQ2)
Infringement Breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and Article
12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the Race
Director’s Event Notes, item 4.2, document 32)
Decision Warning.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed marshalling/positioning data, timing data and
on-board cameras.
Car 10 completed a cool-down lap and maintained his delta for most of the lap
while following a train of other cars with a reasonable gap. By the end of the lap he
was catching the car in front him (Car 63) that was slowing down to prepare for a
flying lap. During the hearing the driver of Car 10 stated that he felt he had to
decide between exceeding the delta time and overtaking Car 63 into the last corner
and thereby risking to impede the latter.
The Stewards accept that the driver of Car 10 made reasonable effort to not
interfere with the car in front of him and was at the same time well aware that no
car was behind him. Nonetheless, the cool-down lap of Car 10 was not impacted by
other cars on flying laps. The Stewards determine that he could have done more to
manage the delta time in a better way and therefore consider a warning to the
driver to be appropriate.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
