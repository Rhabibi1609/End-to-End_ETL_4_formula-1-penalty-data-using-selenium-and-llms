26 - 28 May 2023
From The Stewards Document 17
To The Team Manager, Date 26 May 2023
Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 19:05
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 14) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 17:40
Session Practice 2
Fact Pit lane speeding – 76.2 km/h
Infringment Breach of Article 34.7 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulation and non-
compliance with Race Director’s Event Note (item 13, document 13).
Decision The competitor (Scuderia AlphaTauri) is fined €1,000 and the driver is given a
warning.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda) and team
representative and examined video and timing evidence.
Car 22 exceeded the pit lane speed limit which is set at 60 km/h for this event by 16.2
km/h. The car was entering the pits having struck the barrier at Turn 11, and the
Stewards were concerned that speeding in a pit lane by over 16 kph when there was
unknown damage to the car was potentially dangerous. The driver acknowledged that
he failed to engage the pit speed limiter and understood the potential of the situation.
The Stewards issued a Warning in addition to the mandated fine.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
