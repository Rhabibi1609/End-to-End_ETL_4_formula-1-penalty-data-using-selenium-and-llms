Prescriptions
Pressures & camber
Maximum number of laps permitted for the race on each single set including all tyres history: 18laps.
Laps to the grid, formation laps and laps following the chequered flag for the Sprint and Race will not be counted. For the used sets
effective number of laps considered from previous sessions will be the total amount, reduced by 2laps. For the sake of clarity a
document with remaining laps available for each set will be distributed to the teams.
Cold Pressure Cooling Curve
Pfront = (T - 70) ∙ 0.124 + Pstartf
Prear = (T - 70) ∙ 0.114+ Pstartr
Pstartf: Minimum starting pressure on
the front axle [psi]
Pstartr: Minimum starting pressure on
the rear axle [psi]
T: Tyre temperature [°C]
Maximum heating times and temperatures (tread & sidewall)
Tyres notes
• Not permitted to switch tyres from their originally allocated position.
• Heating time temperature limits apply to the actual tyre surface temperature
• Do not subject tyres to large deformation or heavy impact. measured with the IR gun as detailed in the TD003
• Do not leave fitted tyres exposed at an air temperature lower than 10°C
and/or any excessive UV emission. • Cold cooling curve temperature limits apply to the tyre side wall
temperature measured with the probe as detailed in TD003
• Revised prescriptions could be issued during the race weekend in
accordance with TD003.
• BLANKET HEATING TIME for each temperature range to be counted from the
• Cut-off time for fitting tyres at an event on sunday morning: 4 hours prior to moment the blanket control unit is set to reach its targeted temperature
the race start within its correspondent interval.
General notes
Teams are kindly reminded that the following will be subject to FIA checks during the event:
• Starting pressures
• Cold pressures (according to the cold pressure cooling curves)
• Re-heat pressures
• EOS Camber
• Maximum tyre temperatures and times in blankets
• Tyre swapping
