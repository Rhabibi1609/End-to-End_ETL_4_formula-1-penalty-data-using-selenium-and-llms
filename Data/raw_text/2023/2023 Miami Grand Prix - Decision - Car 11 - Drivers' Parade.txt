Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 18:52
The Stewards, having received a report from the Media Delegate, summoned (document 40) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 13:20
Session Pre-Race
Fact Late attendance of pre-race drivers’ parade.
Infringment Breach of Article 19.4 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Non-driving).
Reason The Stewards received a report from the Media Delegate that the the driver of Car 11
(Sergio Perez), was late for the driver’s parade. The Stewards heard from the team
representative and the driver and determined that the driver was indeed late for the
parade.
The reason for the lateness was the team’s media and other commercial
commitments that the driver had to satisfy before turning up for the parade. We
considered that this was not a valid reason for the lateness. A driver turning up late
for such events can have undesirable resultant consequences for the event and
should be avoided at all times.
In the circumstances, we decided to impose a Reprimand (non-driving) on the driver.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
