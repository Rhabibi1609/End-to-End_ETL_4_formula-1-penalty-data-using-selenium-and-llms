Time 18:13
A protest has been lodged by Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team against the provisional
classification.
The protest claims that a number of cars were not penalized for a breach of Article 33.3 of the
Sporting Regulations.
A hearing will be conducted at 1830 hrs.
In the meantime, the Stewards, having become aware of the existence of a number of deleted laps
(due to exceeding track limits) that were drawn to our attention after the receipt of the protest, have
requested Race Control to perform a reconciliation of all deleted laps with penalties applied.
We note that Race Control dealt with in excess of 100 deleted laps during the race.
