From The FIA Formula One Technical Delegate Document 27
To The Stewards Date 17 June 2023
Time 16:37
Technical Delegate’s Report
The electronically returned tyres (after the end of P3) for car number 23 (Albon) and car number 02
(Sargeant) were not physically returned to the appointed tyre supplier before the start of the
Qualifying session.
Car 23 tyre sets – 23501 / 23504
Car 02 tyre sets – 02503 / 02505
This is non-compliant with Article 30.4 b) of the 2023 Formula One Sporting Regulations. I am
therefore reporting this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
