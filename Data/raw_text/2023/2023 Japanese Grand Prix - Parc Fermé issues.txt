Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night the Williams Racing team worked on car number 02, chassis 03, two hours after
chequered flag of Q3. Chassis 01 got damaged beyond repair during the accident in Q1. As chassis
03 was assembled to more than an assembly comprising a survival cell as defined in SR Article 27.2,
this has to be considered as a third car available to the competitor.
As this is not in compliance with SR Articles 27.2 and 40.6 as well as TD021 G, I am referring this
matter to the Stewards for their consideration.
