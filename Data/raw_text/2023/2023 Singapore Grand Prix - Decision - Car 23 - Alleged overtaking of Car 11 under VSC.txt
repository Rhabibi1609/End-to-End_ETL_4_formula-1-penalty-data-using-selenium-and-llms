The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 42 & 43)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 21:19
Session Race
Fact Car 23 overtaking Car 11 under VSC at 21:19.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 56.6 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2​​ 3 (Alexander Albon), the driver of Car
11 (Sergio Perez), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling
system data, video, timing, team radio and in-car video evidence.
During the VSC period, Car 23 which was exiting the pits and Car 11 which was on
track, arrived at SC2 at the same time. The timing system was unable to determine
that there was any diffence in their respective times of arrival at SC2. Video evidence
was inconclusive when combined with an examination of the SC/VSC delta times.
Each of the team representatives believed that as definitive information was not
available at the time, no further action should occur. The stewards agree with this
view.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
