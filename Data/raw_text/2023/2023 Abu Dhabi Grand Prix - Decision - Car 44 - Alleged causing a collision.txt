Session Race
Fact Car 44 collided with Car 10 at Turn 6 after Car 10 locked its brakes.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, team radio and
in-car video evidence.
Car 10 locked its front right tyre into Turn 6 resulting in that car approaching the turn
on a slightly different line at a slightly lower speed which was obviously unexpected by
the driver of Car 44. Car 44 made light contact with the rear of Car 10 in the Turn.
The Stewards determine that no driver was wholly or predominantly to blame.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.

on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
