Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Scuderia Ferrari team, who are associated with the operation of the
car, were within the confines of the circuit during the eleven and a half hour period which commenced
at 21:05 on 07 July, fourteen hours and twentyfive minutes before the scheduled start time of P3 and
ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 08:30 on 08 July.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the Scuderia Ferrari team during the
2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
