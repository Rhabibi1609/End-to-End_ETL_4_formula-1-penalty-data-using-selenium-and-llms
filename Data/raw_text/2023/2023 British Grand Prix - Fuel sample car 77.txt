Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the qualifying session today it was checked on car number 77, that a 1 liter fuel sample plus the
amount of fuel that would have been consumed to drive back to the pits could be taken (TR Article
6.5.2). It was possible to take a 0.090 litre sample.
As the amount of fuel needed to produce a 1 litre sample plus to return the car to the garage was
calculated as 2.39 litre, I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
