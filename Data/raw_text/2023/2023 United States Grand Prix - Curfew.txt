Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant Formula One Team, who are
associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the fourteen
hour period which commenced at 18:30 on 19 October, eighteen hours before the scheduled start
time of P1 and ends four hours before the scheduled start time of P1 at 08:30 on 20 October.
This was the second of the three individual exceptions permitted for the Aston Martin Aramco
Cognizant Formula One Team during the 2023 Formula One Championship season and therefore no
action should be taken.
