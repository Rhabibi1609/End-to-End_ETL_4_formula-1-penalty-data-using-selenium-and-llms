InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 5 f) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed pit lane CCTV, pit stop position overhead cameras and
timing.
The competitor “double stacked” their cars to change tyres leaving car 40 sticking out
into the transition lane and thereby unnecessarily impeded Car 20 for close to ten
seconds. This is not permitted by the code.

Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
