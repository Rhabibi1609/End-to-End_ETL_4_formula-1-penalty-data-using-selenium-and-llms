From The Stewards Document 18
To All Officials, All Teams Date 20 October 2023
Time 17:30
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter
and determine the following:
Session Qualifying
Fact The cars below exceeded the 1:56.0-time limit between the Safety Car lines.
No Car Driver Competitor Time of Day Lap
1 22 Yuki Tsunoda Scuderia AlphaTauri 16:08:26 2 (Q1)
2 3 Daniel Ricciardo Scuderia AlphaTauri 16:08:32 2 (Q1)
3 18 Lance Stroll Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team 16:09:01 2 (Q1)
4 3 Daniel Ricciardo Scuderia AlphaTauri 16:17:03 5 (Q1)
Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 4.2, document 15)
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras.
All drivers concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:56.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, in all cases the Stewards
determined that the drivers took appropriate actions to not impede other drivers,
and in all cases they slowed down significantly to allow other drivers to pass while
giving those drivers a clear track. The Stewards therefore determine that all drivers
concerned did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and that evidently the reason they
were above the maximum time was due to their appropriate actions and take no
further action.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
