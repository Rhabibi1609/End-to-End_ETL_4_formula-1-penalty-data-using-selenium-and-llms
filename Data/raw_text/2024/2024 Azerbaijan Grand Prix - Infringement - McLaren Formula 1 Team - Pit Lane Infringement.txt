InfringementBreach of Article 34.13 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (McLaren Formula 1 Team) is fined €5,000.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative and reviewed video evidence.
While it is not unusual for team personnel to move towards the Parc Fermé area
before the end of the race, McLaren had team members and equipment in the pit lane
while other teams were still pitting and thus created a potentially unsafe condition.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
