and 27 did not exceed 80 km/h when leaving the formation grid prior to the start of the race.
It was verified on all cars that the PCU dash display configuration was not changed during Parc
Fermé.
The tyre starting pressures of all cars during the race were checked.
The tyres used by all drivers during the race today have been checked.
A fuel sample was taken from car number 04.
The fuel samples have been checked for density and analysed by gas chromatography.
The results of all the fuel analyses show that the fuels were the same as ones, which had been
approved for use by the relevant competitors prior to the Competition.
Further the density change of the fuel samples taken today was within the permitted limits.
An engine oil sample was taken from car number 04.
The engine oil samples have been analysed by FTIR spectroscopy and viscometry.

All car weights and the items checked were found to be in conformity with the 2024 FIA Formula One
Technical Regulations.
After the race car number 10 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more extensive
physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the fuel tank, the fuel tank fillers and breathers, the
components installed inside the fuel cell and up to the self-sealing breakaway connector, a CAD
inspection of the fuel system’s hydraulic layout up to the self-sealing breakaway connector to the
engine as well as the control electronics of the components inside the fuel cell.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2024 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
