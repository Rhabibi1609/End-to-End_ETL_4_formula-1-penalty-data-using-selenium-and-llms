Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Williams Racing team, who are associated with the operation
of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the twelve and a half (12.5) hour period
which commenced at 21:00 on 22 March, fifteen and a half (15.5) hours before the scheduled
start time of P3 and ends three (3) hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 09:30 on 23
March.
This was the first of the two (2) individual exceptions permitted for the Williams Racing team
during the 2024 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
