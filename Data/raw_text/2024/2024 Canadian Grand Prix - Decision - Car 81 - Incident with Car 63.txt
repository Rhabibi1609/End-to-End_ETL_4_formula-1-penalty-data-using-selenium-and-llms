The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 53 & 54)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 15:40
Session Race
Fact Incident between Cars 81 and 63 in Turn 13 and 14.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), the driver of Car 63
(George Russell), team representatives and reviewed video and in-car video
evidence.
The driver of Car 63 attempted to overtake Car 81 on the outside into Turn 13, got
fully alongside, but, given the nature of the turn and the track conditions, failed to
complete the manoeuvre and both cars slightly touched at the apex. He then aborted
the overtaking attempt, left the track and rejoined safely and without gaining any
lasting advantage.
The Stewards determine that no driver was wholly or predominantly at fault and
therefore take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
