The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 40 & 41)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 21:31
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 55 was released into the path of Car 44.
InfringementBreach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Scuderia Ferrari) is fined â‚¬5,000.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 55 (Carlos Sainz), the driver of Car 44
(Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed external video and in-car video
evidence.
The representative of Car 55 admitted that the Number 1 mechanic responsible for
releasing Car 55, signalled the car to be released prior to the driver being ready. This
resulted in a small delay which in turn resulted in the car being released into the path
of Car 44, requiring the driver of Car 44 to take avoiding action.
This is a breach of Article 34.14 and consistent with similar cases this year, the
penalty above is imposed.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
