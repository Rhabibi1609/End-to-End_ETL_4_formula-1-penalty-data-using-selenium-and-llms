The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 77 - Valtteri Bottas
Competitor Kick Sauber F1 Team
Time 17:49
Session Race
Fact Car 77 caused a collision with Car 20 in turn 6.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 5 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
3 penalty points (total of 5 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Car 77 was on the inside of Car 20 on the approach to Turn 6, misjudged his braking
significantly and collided with Car 20 which was entering the corner on the regular
racing line.
As Car 77 retired from the race, the Steward determine that a grid drop is warranted
which is the equivalent of a drive-through penalty and three penalty points are
warranted due to the significant misjudgement of the driver.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
