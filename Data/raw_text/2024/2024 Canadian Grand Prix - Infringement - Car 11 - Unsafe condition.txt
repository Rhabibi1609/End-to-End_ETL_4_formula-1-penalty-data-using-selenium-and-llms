The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 51) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 15:22
Session Race
Fact Car 11 failed to leave the track with serious mechanical difficulties after significantly
damaging the rear wing.
InfringementBreach of Article 26.10 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Oracle Red Bull Racing) is fined €25,000.
Additionally, a drop of three grid positions for the next race in which the driver
participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 11 (Sergio Perez), team representative
and reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence.
After making contact with the barriers in Turn 6, the driver continued on track for the
remainder of the lap with a significantly damaged car and thereby lost several carbon
fibre parts on the way back to the pits. The team confirmed in the hearing that the
driver had been advised to bring the car back to the pits as they were trying to avoid a
Safety Car situation.
The Stewards determine that, as well as a financial penalty for the team, a sporting
penalty is necessary due to the safety implications of the incident. The penalty is
imposed in line with precedents.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
