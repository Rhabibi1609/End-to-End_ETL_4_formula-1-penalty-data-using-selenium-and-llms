The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 27, 29 &
30) and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 13:14
Session Practice 3
Fact Car 81 allegedly impeding Car 3 in turn 7.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), the driver of Car 16
(Charles Leclerc), the driver of Car 3 (Daniel Ricciardo), team representatives and
reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence.
At the approach to Turn 7 the drivers of Cars 81 and 16, on cool down laps, were
both aware, via radio, of the approach of Car 3 on a push lap.
After the apex, the driver of Car 81 saw Car 16 behind, and believed it would stay
behind, as Car 16 had been behind for some time. He also checked his mirrors and
expected Car 3 to overtake him on the left, so he moved further to the right to allow
more space for Car 3.
The driver of Car 16 however, thought Car 81 would remain on the left, and decided
that it would make more room for Car 3, if he overtook Car 81 on the right and moved
ahead of him. In making the overtake, Car 16 had to put two wheels off the track to
avoid Car 81 which was moving to the right.
The driver of Car 3 stated that he saw both cars side by side and decided to abort his
lap rather than risk trying to pass them.
The three drivers and their representatives agreed that the situation was caused
through a misunderstanding by the drivers of Cars 81 and 16 about each otherâ€™s
intentions, which were both well-intended.
The Stewards agree with this conclusion and decide to take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
