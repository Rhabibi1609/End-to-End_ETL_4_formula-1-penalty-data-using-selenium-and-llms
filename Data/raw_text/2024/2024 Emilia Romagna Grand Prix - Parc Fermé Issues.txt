Time 11:37
Technical Delegate’s Report
During the Parc Fermé yesterday and today, the Aston Martin Aramco Formula One Team has
made changes to the set up of the suspension of car number 14. Therefore car number 14 should
now be required to start the Race from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 of the 2024 Formula
One Sporting Regulations.
I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
