The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 13:34
Session Sprint
Fact The driver of Car 4 made several manoeuvres in the final lap of the race which were
reported by the Race Director to the Stewards.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 33.4 of the Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence.
There did not appear to be any significant changes of direction under braking, and the
move at Turn 15 was a legitimate defending move by the driver of Car 4. In Turn 1
Car 4 locked up under braking and went wide, losing a position.
Accordingly the Stewards determine that there is no erratic driving and hence take no
further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
