Time 11:45
In accordance with the regulations, the Stewards received a notification from Williams Racing that
they are withdrawing Car 2, Driver Logan Sargeant, from the 2024 Australian Grand Prix.
The team submitted a new self-scrutineering form for Car 23 to the Technical Delegate, following a
change of “survival cell” under Article 27 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. (See Doc.
21, Technical Delegate’s Report.)
The team declared that following the crash of Car 23 in FP1, they have used the “survival cell”
previously registered for Car 2 and other components already registered to Car 23 and driver Alex
Albon, to rebuild the car.
This is all in accordance with the regulations.
