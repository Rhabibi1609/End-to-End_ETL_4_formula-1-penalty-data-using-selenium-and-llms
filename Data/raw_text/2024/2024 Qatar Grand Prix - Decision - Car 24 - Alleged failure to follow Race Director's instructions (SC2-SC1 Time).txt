Kick Sauber F1 Team
Time 18:35
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 33) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Kick Sauber F1 Team
Time 16:32
Session Pre-Sprint
Fact Car 24 exceeded the time limit between the Safety Car lines.
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Director’s Event Note (item 2, document 3).
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 24 (Zhou Guanyu), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, team radio and in-
car video evidence.
The driver concerned stated that he was slow at the start of the reconnaissance lap
because he was on cold hard compound tyres, then when he realised he was not on
the right delta, it was too late on those tyres, to make up the lost time. He did not
impede any other driver, he did not drive dangerously and there was no sporting
advantage as the tyres were changed on the grid for softs. The Stewards determine
that the driver did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and therefore take no further
action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
