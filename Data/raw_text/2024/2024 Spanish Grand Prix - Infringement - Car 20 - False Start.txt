Fact False start.
InfringementBreach of Article 48.1 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Car 20 moved after the 4 second light was illuminated and before the start signal was
given, this being a breach of Article 48.1.
The Stewards acknowledge that the movement was very slight and no significant
sporting advantage was gained and therefore impose the least severe penalty
applicable to such infringement.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
