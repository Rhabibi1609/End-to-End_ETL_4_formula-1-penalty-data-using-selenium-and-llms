After the race in Austin, car number 63 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more
extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections was the ICE water system including the heat exchangers, the
standard pressure and temperature sensors, their loom routing and connections to the SECU and

All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2024 Formula One Technical
