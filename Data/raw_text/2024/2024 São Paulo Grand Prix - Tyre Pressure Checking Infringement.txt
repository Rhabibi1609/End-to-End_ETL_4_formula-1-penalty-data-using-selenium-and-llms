2024 SÃO PAULO GRAND PRIX
01 - 03 November 2024
From The FIA Formula One Technical Delegate Document 66
To The Stewards Date 03 November 2024
Time 13:13
Technical Delegate’s Report
On the grid and when the race start was aborted, between the 10 minutes and the 5 minutes signal,
on car numbers 63 and 44, the tyre pressures were adjusted (pressure released) with wheels
already fitted to the car.
As this is in contradiction to TD003 N, items 2. c) and 2. h) i., I am referring this matter to the
stewards for their consideration.
