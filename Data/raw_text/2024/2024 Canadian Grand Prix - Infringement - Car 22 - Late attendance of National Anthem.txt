Time 20:04
The Stewards, having received a report from the Media Delegate, summoned (document 50) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Visa Cash App RB F1 Team
Time 13:47
Session Pre-race
Fact Late attendance of the National Anthem.
InfringementBreach of Article 19.4 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Visa Cash App RB F1 Team) is fined €10,000.
Reason The Stewards received a report from the Media Delegate that the driver of Car 22
(Yuki Tsunoda) was late for the National Anthem. The Stewards reviewed video
evidence and determined that the driver was indeed late for the anthem.
The team stated that they failed to inform the driver about the timing adequately and
therefore caused the delay, but it is also the responsibility of the driver to arrive in
time. It is noted that the driver, once made aware of his mistake, took every
reasonable effort to attend the National Anthem as soon as possible.
The Stewards acknowledge that attending the National Anthem is an important
element of the pre-race procedures and a sign of respect for the host country of the
event.
The Stewards note that the precedents are implying a less severe penalty
(reprimand), but feel that escalating the penalty to a fine is appropriate.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
