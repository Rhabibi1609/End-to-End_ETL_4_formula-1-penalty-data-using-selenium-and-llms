Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
During free practice session 3, it was noted that the tyre pressures of Set 503 on Car 16 were
altered whilst the car was stationary in the pit-stop position. This adjustment was not carried out in
accordance with the procedures set out in TD003N 2. g. ii..
I am referring this to the stewards for their consideration.
