Session Qualifying
Fact Cars forming up in the pit lane prior to the start of a session.
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1.i of the International Sporting Code.
Decision Warning.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car ¬ 24 (Zhou Guanyu), team representative
and reviewed video evidence and found that the driver of Car 24 was attempting to
form up in the fast lane prior to the start of a session.
Car 24 had a very small portion of the car in the fast lane but ultimately had to stop
and wait for other cars to pass before joining the fast lane.
The Race Director had verbally instructed all the team managers to ensure that when
drivers are attempting to join the fast lane when cars are stationary, they would have
to wait until the last car in the stationary line had passed them before joining the fast
lane.
It was clear to us that Car 24 did not follow this instruction and instructed the driver to
join in front of Car 3. We accordingly issue a warning to the team to follow Race
Director’s instructions in the future.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
