Time 16:35
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 15:32
Session Race
Fact Car 4 left the track at turn 12 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence.
Car 4 was overtaking Car 1 on the outside, but was not level with Car 1 at the apex.
Therefore under the Driving Standards Guidelines, Car 4 had lost the “right” to the
corner. Accordingly as Car 4 left the track and returned in front of Car 1, it is deemed
to be a case of leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage.
A 5 second penalty is imposed instead of the 10 second penalty recommended in the
guidelines because having committed to the overtaking move on the outside the driver
of Car 4 had little alternative other than to leave the track because of the proximity of
Car 1 which had also left the track.
In view of the above, we determine that this will not count as a track limit “strike” for
Car 4.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
