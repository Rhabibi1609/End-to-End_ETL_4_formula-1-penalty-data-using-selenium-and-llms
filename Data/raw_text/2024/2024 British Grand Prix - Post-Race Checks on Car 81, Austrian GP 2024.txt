Technical Delegate’s Report
After the race of the Austrian GP, car number 81 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for
more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections was the pit-stop system (equipment and control) like the wheel
guns, front and rear jacks, pneumatic system and traffic light; as well as all attached sensors, their
loom routing and connections to the controller.
In particular the following actions were performed to validate compliance with TR 10.9.2 and TD022:
Pit-stop equipment sealed and inspected.
Analysis and verification of data and video from the race.
Post-race mock pit-stop scenarios performed and data reviewed.
Controller software inspected.
Checked that documents required in Appendix 2 of TD022 were present and accurate in comparison
with the equipment used for the pit-stop.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2024 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
