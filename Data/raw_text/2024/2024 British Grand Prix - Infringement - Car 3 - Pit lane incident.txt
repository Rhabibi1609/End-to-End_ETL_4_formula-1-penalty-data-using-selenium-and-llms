heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 3 - Daniel Ricciardo
Competitor Visa Cash App RB F1 Team
Time 11:39
Session Practice 3
Fact Car 3 was weaving in the Pit Lane.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving).
This is the driver’s 1st reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 3 (Daniel Ricciardo), team representative
and reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence.
The team instructed the driver to keep the temperatures up in the tyres on the way
into the pits and the driver chose to weave when in the fast lane.
A number of other team personnel were present in other team pits immediately
adjacent to the fast lane and there was the risk that the weaving of Car 3 might have
resulted in contact with these personnel, especially considering the wet conditions.
The driver of Car 3 acknowledged that his actions “were not a good look” and
assured the Stewards that they would never see him repeat those actions.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
