Technical Delegate’s Report
During the Parc Fermé today, the Williams Racing team has made changes to the rear wing
specification and to the set-up of the suspension of car number 23, driver Alexander Albon, without
the approval of the FIA technical delegate. Therefore car number 23 should now be required to start
the Sprint from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 of the 2024 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
