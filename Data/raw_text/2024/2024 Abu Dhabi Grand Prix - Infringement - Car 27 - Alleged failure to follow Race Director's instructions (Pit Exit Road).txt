Time 21:20
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 33) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 27 - Nico Hulkenberg
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 18:15
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 27 overtook 2 cars in the tunnel section of the pit exit road.
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and Note 12.4 of the
Race Director’s Event Notes (document 13).
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 27 (Nico Hulkenberg), team
representative and reviewed marshalling system data, video, timing and in-car video
evidence.
The driver did not dispute during the hearing that he did not follow the Race Director’s
instructions, but stated that he had no other option but to breach the rules in order to
get a lap in.
Whilst the Stewards acknowledge that the position of the team’s garages limits their
options to send the cars out on track, this can never be used as an excuse to breach
any regulations. The prohibition of overtaking in certain areas as the pit lane or, in this
case, the pit exit, is implemented to prevent potentially dangerous situations and
therefore the Stewards determine that a grid drop is warranted in this case.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
