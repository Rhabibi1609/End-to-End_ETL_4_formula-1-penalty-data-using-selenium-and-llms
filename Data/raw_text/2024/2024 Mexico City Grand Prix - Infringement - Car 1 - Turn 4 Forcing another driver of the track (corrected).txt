The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 14:20
Session Race
Fact Forcing another driver off the track.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 6 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, radio and in-car
video evidence.
Norris was attempting to overtake on the outside of Verstappen at Turn 4. Norris was
ahead of Verstappen at the entry, apex and towards the exit of the turn when he
started being forced off the track. The Stewards believe that the maneuver was done
in a safe and controlled manner and that Norris would have been able to make the
maneuver on the track had he not been forced off the track by Verstappen. Norris cut
the corner but immediately gave the position he gained as a result back to Sainz.
The penalty is the standard penalty in such cases.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
