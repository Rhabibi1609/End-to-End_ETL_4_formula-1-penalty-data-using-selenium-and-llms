Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Oracle Red Bull Racing team, who are associated with the
operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the eleven and a half (11.5) hour
period which commenced at 22:00 on 26 July, fourteen and a half (14.5) hours before the scheduled
start time of P3 and ends three (3) hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 09:30 on 27 July.
This was the first (1) of the two (2) individual exceptions permitted for the Oracle Red Bull Racing
team during the 2024 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
