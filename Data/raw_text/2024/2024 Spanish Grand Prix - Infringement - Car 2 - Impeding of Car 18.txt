Time 18:30
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 31 & 32)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 2 - Logan Sargeant
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 16:09
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 2 unnecessarily impeded Car 18 in turn 10.
InfringementBreach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2 (Logan Sargeant), the driver of Car 18
(Lance Stroll), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car video
evidence.
Car 2 impeded Car 18 into Turn 10. Although the driver of Car 2 reacted
appropriately after spotting Car 18 in his mirrors, he relied on getting adequate
information from the team on the straight between Turns 9 and 10, with the team
failing to inform the driver in time.
It has been agreed that a team failing to inform their driver of incoming traffic cannot
be regarded as an excuse for such an infringement. The Stewards therefore
determine that Car 2 unnecessarily impeded Car 18 and impose a grid drop in line
with precedents.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
