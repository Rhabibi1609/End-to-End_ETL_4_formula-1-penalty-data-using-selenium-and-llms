The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 18:22
Session Reconnaissance Laps
Fact Car 81 appeared to be driven erratically into the pit lane after a reconnaissance lap.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 e) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision Warning.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, telemetry, video and in-car video
evidence.
The driver explained the two cars in front of him were travelling very slowly and he
wished to overtake them. The team provided telemetry evidence that Car 81 was not
travelling at excessive speed and that the driver was in control at all times. Although
the manoeuvre appeared erratic on the video, we did not determine that it was
dangerous. However such erratic manoeuvres should be avoided, hence the penalty
of a formal warning is applied
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
