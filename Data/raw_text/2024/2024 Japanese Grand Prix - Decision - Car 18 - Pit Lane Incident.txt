Session Race
Fact Pit Lane incident.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV Article 5 b) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Car 18 exited the pit stop in the working lane slightly behind Car 20 in the fast lane.
Appendix L Chapter IV Article 5 b) states that Car 18 should blend into the fast lane
as soon as it is safe to do so and without impeding any car in the fast lane. Because
Car 20 was in the fast lane and was followed closely by Car 77, it is not possible to
determine that Car 18 could have blended prior to the Pit Exit.
At the Pit Exit line, Car 18 was still behind Car 20.
Car 18 overtook Car 20 in the Pit Exit Road. This is not prohibited.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
