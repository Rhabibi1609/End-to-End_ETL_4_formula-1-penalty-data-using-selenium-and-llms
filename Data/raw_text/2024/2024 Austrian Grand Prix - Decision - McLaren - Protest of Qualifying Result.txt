Protest lodged by McLaren Formula 1 Team against the deletion of a lap time (1:04.786) set
by the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri) in Q3
Stewards’ Decision:
The Protest is rejected as it is inadmissible.
Procedure
1. On June 29, 2024 following the publication of the Provisional Classification for the Qualifying
for the Austrian Grand Prix, McLaren Formula 1 Team lodged a protest against the deletion
of a lap time (1.04.786) set by the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri) in Q3.
2. The Stewards first convened a hearing with McLaren to determine the admissibility, or
otherwise, of the Protest.
3. Present at that Hearing were the Team Principal, Andrea Stella, and Team Manager,
Randeep Singh.
Admissibility
4. The protest was lodged in writing (Article 13.4.1 ISC).
5. It was accompanied by a deposit of EUR 2,000 (Article 13.4.2 ISC).
6. It was addressed to the Clerk of the Course and not to the Chairperson of the Stewards
(Article 13.5.1 ISC).
7. It did not specify any relevant regulations (Article 13.4.1 ISC).
8. It did not specify against whom the protest was lodged (Article 13.4.1 ISC).
9. It did identify the concerns of the protesting party (Article 13.4.1 ISC).
Conclusions of the Stewards
10. The subject matter of the protest was a decision (deletion of a relevant lap time in
accordance with Article 12.4.1 e) of the FIA International Sporting Code) taken by the
Stewards. A decision of the Stewards is not open to protest (Article 12.3.3 ISC).
11. Additionally, the protest does not meet several of the required criteria for the admissibility of a
protest (ref. points 6 to 8 above).
12. The Stewards therefore reject the protest as it is inadmissible.
13. The protest deposit is forfeited.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the Stewards, in
accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial
and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely on the relevant
regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
