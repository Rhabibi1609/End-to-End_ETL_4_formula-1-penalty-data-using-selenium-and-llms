The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 14:32
Session Race
Fact Alleged forcing another driver off the track.
Alleged Leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage.
InfringementAlleged Breach of Appendix L Chapter IV Article 2 b) and c) of the FIA International
Sporting Code and Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, CCTV, timing,
and in-car video evidence.
Perez was attempting to pass Lawson on the inside of Turn 4. Perez had a significant
portion of the car to the inside of Lawson at the apex of Turn 4, however to do so he
was significantly on the kerb, and in the view of the Stewards the maneuver was late.
As a result his exit was not anywhere near the racing line, ran wide and Lawson had
to go off track to avoid a collision. Perez gave room to Lawson to stay on track at
Turn 5, but then Perez went off track at the exit of Turn 5. Perez then conceded to
Lawson and did not keep any advantage.
In the view of the Stewards, this was a racing incident and take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
