2024 BELGIAN GRAND PRIX

Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the Race, car number 63 was weighed and its weight was 798.0 kg, which is the minimum
weight required by TR Article 4.1. After this, fuel was drained out of the car and 2.8 litres of fuel were
removed. The car was not fully drained according to the draining procedure submitted by the team in
their legality documents as TR Article 6.5.2 is fulfilled. The car was weighed again on the FIA inside
and outside scales and the weight was 796.5 kg. The calibration of the outside and inside scales was
confirmed and witnessed by the competitor.
As this is 1.5 kg below the minimum weight requested in TR Article 4.1, which also has to be
respected at all times during the Competition, I am referring this matter to the Stewards for their
consideration.
