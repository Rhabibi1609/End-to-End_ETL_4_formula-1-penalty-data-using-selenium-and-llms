Time 20:31
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 77 & 78)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 17:06
Session Race
Fact Collision between Car 55 and Car 81 in Turn 17.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
(5 seconds added to elapsed Race time).
1 penalty points (total of 1 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), the driver of Car 55
(Carlos Sainz), team representatives and reviewed video evidence and determined
that Car 55 was overtaking Car 81 at Turn 17 when he lost the rear slightly and
collided with Car 81. The collision resulted in damage to the front wing of Car 81.
It was clear to us that Car 55 was to blame for the collision. In the overtake attempt,
Car 55 braked late, missed the apex and in the process lost the rear, with the
resulting collision. Although Car 81 was trying to turn in to counter the overtaking
attempt, Car 81 gave sufficient room to Car 55.
In the circumstances, we find Car 55 to be predominantly to blame for the collision.
In this case, we took into account, as mitigating factors, the fact that but for the slight
loss of control of the rear by Car 55, the collision would likely not have happened and
it would have been hard but good racing. The standard penalty for a collision is 10
seconds with 2 penalty points. In light of the mitigating circumstances, we therefore
impose a 5 second time penalty with 1 penalty point.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
