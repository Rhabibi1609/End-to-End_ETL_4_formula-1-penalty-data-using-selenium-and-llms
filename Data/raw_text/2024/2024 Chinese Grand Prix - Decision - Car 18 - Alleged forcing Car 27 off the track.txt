The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 15:05
Session Race
Fact Car 18 forced Car 27 off the track at Turn 6.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, and in-car video
evidence and determined that Car 18 did not force Car 27 off the track.
Using the Driving Standard Guidelines as a point of reference, Car 18 clearly had its
front axle at least alongside the mirror of the other car by the apex of the corner.
The car was driven in a safe and controlled manner throughout the manoeuvre (entry,
apex and exit) and did not, in our view, (deliberately) force the other car off the track
at the exit. The line taken by Car 18 was a natural line for that corner and we could
not expect Car 18, in these circumstances, to have taken a different line to create
further space for Car 27.
It also appears to us that Car 27 may have left the track briefly because the car
bottomed out over the kerb.
In the circumstances, we took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
