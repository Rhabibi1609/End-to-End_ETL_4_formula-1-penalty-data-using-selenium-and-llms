The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 20:15
Session Race
Fact Unsafe release of car 11.
InfringementBreach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
1 penalty point (total of 8 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined
that Car 11 was released from a pit stop in an unsafe manner. Car 14 had to take
evasive action to avoid a collision. What made the situation worse was the fact that
Car 11 left the pits when there was a red light shown to it (indicating that it should not
go out of the pit box). We therefore imposed a 5 second time penalty and 1 penalty
point.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
