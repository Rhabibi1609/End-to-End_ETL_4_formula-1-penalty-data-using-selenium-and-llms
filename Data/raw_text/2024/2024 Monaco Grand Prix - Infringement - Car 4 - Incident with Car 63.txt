Time 15:10
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 20 & 21)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 13:15
Session Practice 3
Fact Incident between Cars 4 and 63 at T10.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving).
This is the driver’s 2nd reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 4 (Lando Norris), the driver of Car 63
(George Russell), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car
video evidence and determined that Car 4 deliberately moved towards Car 63 to
express his displeasure at his lap being affected by Car 63 at the exit of the tunnel on
the approach to Turn 10.
While in this instance the move was not dangerous, this sort of action could
potentially lead to a dangerous situation and should be avoided. We therefore impose
a reprimand on the driver of Car 4.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
