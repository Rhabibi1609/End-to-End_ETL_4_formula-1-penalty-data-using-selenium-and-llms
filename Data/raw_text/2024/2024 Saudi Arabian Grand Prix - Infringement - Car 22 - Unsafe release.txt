The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Visa Cash App RB F1 Team
Time 20:32
Session Race (Reconnaissance Laps)
Fact Unsafe release of car 22.
InfringementBreach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence and heard from
the drivers and team representatives of Car 22 and Car 4 and determined that Car
22 was released unsafely from the garage during the reconnaissance lap into the
path of Car 4 which had to take evasive action to avoid a collision.
The driver of Car 22 admitted that he did not see the Number 1 in his team signalling
not to come out as his attention was diverted towards exiting the car from the garage.
He apologized for his oversight.
An unsafe release during the race (which would include the reconnaissance lap)
would typically attract a 5 second time penalty, which is what we imposed. In addition,
for an infringement of this nature, it would be appropriate to award 1 penalty point.
Given that this took place during the reconnaissance lap as opposed to the race
proper, we decided to not impose the penalty point.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
