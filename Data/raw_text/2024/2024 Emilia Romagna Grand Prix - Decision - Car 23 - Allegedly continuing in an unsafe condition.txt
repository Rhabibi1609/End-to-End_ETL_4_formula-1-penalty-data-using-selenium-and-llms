The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 51) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 15:14
Session Race
Fact Car 23 driven on track following a release in an unsafe condition.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 34.14 e) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 2​​ 3 (Alexander Albon), team
representative and reviewed in-car video evidence and team radio.
The Stewards accepted Albon’s explanation, which was supported by In-Car video,
that while he knew something was wrong with the car, it did not look from his position
to be a classic loose wheel, not captured by the wheel nut. He was shown the green
light by the team to exit the pits, and the team did not call him as they did not know at
the time that the wheel was loose. Rather, Albon heard a metallic scraping noise,
reported that something was wrong and drove the car carefully to the pits. The
Stewards agreed that this was accomplished in a safe and appropriate manner,
without affecting any other competitor and that the driver did not drive the car knowing
it to be in an unsafe condition. The Stewards take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
