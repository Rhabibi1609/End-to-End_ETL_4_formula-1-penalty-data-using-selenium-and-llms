Session Practice 2

InfringementAlleged breach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-
compliance with Race Director’s Event Note (item 15, document 4).
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 4 (Lando Norris), team representative
and reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Whilst the driver of Car 4 went off track on the inside of turn 14, he touched the
orange kerb and therefore was not required to go around the orange bollard before
rejoining the track. Therefore no infringement occured. It is noted that the driver did
not rejoin the track in an unsafe manner nor did he gain any lasting advantage.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and

on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
