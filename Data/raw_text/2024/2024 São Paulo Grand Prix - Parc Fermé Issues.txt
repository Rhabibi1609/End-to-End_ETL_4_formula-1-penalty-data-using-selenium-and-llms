Technical Delegate’s Report
The bodywork specification and the suspension set-up of car numbers 18 and 14 have been
changed with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written request from the team
concerned.
Therefore car numbers 18 and 14 should now be required to start the Sprint from the pit lane
according to Article 40.9 of the 2024 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
The suspension set-up of car number 24 has been changed without the approval of the FIA technical
delegate.
Therefore car number 24 should now be required to start the Sprint from the pit lane according to
Article 40.9 of the 2024 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
I am referring these matters to the stewrds for their consideration.
