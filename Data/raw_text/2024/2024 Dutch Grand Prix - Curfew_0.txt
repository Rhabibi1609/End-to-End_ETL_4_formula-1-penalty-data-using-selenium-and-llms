Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the MoneyGram Haas F1 Team, who are associated with the operation
of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the eleven and a half (11.5) hour period
which commenced at 21:00 on 23 August, fourteen and a half (14.5) hours before the scheduled
start time of P3 and ends three (3) hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 08:30 on 24
August.
This was the first of the two (2) individual exceptions permitted for the MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
during the 2024 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
