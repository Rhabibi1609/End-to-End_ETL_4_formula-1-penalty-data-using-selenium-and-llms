Niels Wittich
The FIA Formula One Race Director
In agreement with the FIA and in accordance with Article 30.5 a) of the F1 Sporting Regulations, this document contains the prescriptions for
the operation of tyres during the following event.
Document version 1 Issue A
Bahrain Pre-Season Test 21/02-23/02/2024 (24T01BAH)
Pressures & camber
Cold Pressure Cooling Curve
Pfront = (T - 70) ∙ 0.115 + Pstartf
Prear = (T - 70) ∙ 0.107+ Pstartr
Pstartf: Minimum starting pressure on
the front axle [psi]
Pstartr: Minimum starting pressure on
the rear axle [psi]
T: Tyre temperature [°C]
Maximum heating times and temperatures (tread & sidewall)
• Not permitted to switch tyres from their originally allocated position.
• Do not subject tyres to large deformation or heavy impact.
• Do not leave fitted tyres exposed at an air temperature lower than 10°C and/or any excessive UV emission.
• Revised prescriptions could be issued during the event in accordance with TD003.
• Heating time temperature limits apply to the actual tyre surface temperature measured with the IR gun as detailed in the TD003
• BLANKET HEATING TIME for each temperature range to be counted from the moment the blanket control unit is set to reach its targeted temperature
within its correspondent interval
• Cold cooling curve temperature limits apply to the tyre side wall temperature measured with the probe as detailed in TD003
Teams are kindly reminded that the following will be subject to FIA checks during the event:
• Starting pressures
• Cold pressures (according to the cold pressure cooling curves)
• Re-heat pressures
• EOS Camber
• Maximum tyre temperatures and times in blankets
• Tyre swapping
