NOTE TO TEAMS: CAR DISPLAY PROCEDURE
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations, please
note the following procedures for the Car Presentation and Display at this Competition:
Between 12:00 and 13:00 on Friday, one car from each team must be positioned in their pit stop
position, with the other car positioned and available for viewing inside the garage. If only one car will carry
the major aerodynamic and bodywork components and assemblies that have not been run at a previous
Competition or TCC and are intended to be run at the Competition, this car must be the one displayed to
media.
The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking place the car must
return to the same position. Teams selected for the presentation may not carry out pit stop practice during
their allocated presentation timeslot.
At any Competition where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the cars in
position and use awnings. Given the hot weather conditions forecasted, awnings may be used during
the car presentation period.
Any media wishing to take photographs must stay in the fast lane of the pit lane. For the avoidance of
doubt this includes taking still images with professional cameras, mobile phones or any other device. TV
Crews are allowed to shoot in the working lane of the pit lane.
The cars below have been selected for presentations:
• 12:05 - car 14
• 12:25 - car 77
• 12:45 - car 1
Each team that is selected must have the technical representative indicated previously to the FIA available
at these times.
