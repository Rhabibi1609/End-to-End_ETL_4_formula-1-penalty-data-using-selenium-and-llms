Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
The Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team did not cover car number 63, driver George
Russell, two (2) hours after the end of the qualifying session, but continued to work on the car.
As this is not in compliance with Article 40.6 of the 2024 Formula One Sporting Regulations, I am
referring this matter to the Stewards of the meeting for their consideration.
