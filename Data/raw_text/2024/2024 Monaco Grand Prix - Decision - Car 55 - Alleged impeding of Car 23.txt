Time 19:46
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 28 & 29)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 16:04
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 55 allegedly unnecessarily impeded Car 23 in turn 15.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 55 ( Carlos Sainz), the driver of Car 23 (
Alexander Albon), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car
video evidence and determined that Car 23 was on a push lap and caught Car 55 at
the chicane at Turns 15/16.
The driver of Car 55 was informed by the team of the approach of Car 23. The driver
of Car 55 attempted to move as quickly as he could off the racing line to give Car 23
space at the exit of Turn 16. However, given the tight nature of the chicane and the
Monaco circuit, Car 23 was impacted by Car 55’s presence at the chicane.
The driver of Car 55 stated on hindsight that he could perhaps have gone off the
track and thereby given Car 23 more room but felt that he did not unnecessarily
impede Car 23 as he took the necessary steps on the track to give him space.
The driver of Car 23 was able to complete his push lap and although he may have lost
a tenth and a half in terms of time and was therefore affected, he said it was, in his
mind, “grey” as to whether or not he was unnecessarily impeded by Car 55. He did
not think this was a clear case of impeding. He acknowledged that the part of the
circuit was particularly difficult at it is a sequence of blind corners and that Car 55
could not have seen Car 23 approaching any sooner.
In the light of the above, we took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented
