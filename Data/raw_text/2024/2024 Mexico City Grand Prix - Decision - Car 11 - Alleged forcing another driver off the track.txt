The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 14:33
Session Race
Fact Alleged forcing another driver off the track.
InfringementAlleged Breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, CCTV, and in-car
video evidence.
Stroll was attempting to overtake Perez on the outside of Turn 4. However, Stroll was
never fully alongside, and was not “entitled” to racing room at the exit and Perez’ line
was normal for that turn. The Stewards considered that Perez never left the track
during the maneuver, and did not unfairly force Stroll off the track. Therefore, the
Stewards take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
