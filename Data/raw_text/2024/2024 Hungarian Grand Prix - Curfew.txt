Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team, who are
associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the eleven and
a half (11.5) hour period which commenced at 22:00 on 19 July, fourteen and a half (14.5) hours
before the scheduled start time of P3 and ends three (3) hours before the scheduled start time of P3
at 09:30 on 20 July.
This was the first of the two (2) individual exceptions permitted for the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS
Formula One Team during the 2024 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action
should be taken.
