Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 2, document 4)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras.
All drivers concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:31.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, in all cases the Stewards
determined that the drivers took appropriate actions to not impede other drivers,
and in all cases they slowed down significantly to allow other drivers to pass while
giving those drivers a clear track. The Stewards therefore determine that all
drivers concerned did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and that evidently the
reason they were above the maximum time was due to their appropriate actions
and take no further action. The Stewards further note that Zhou had a technical
issue leaving the pits on lap 4 of Q1 but nevertheless did not affect the safe and
orderly conduct of the event.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
