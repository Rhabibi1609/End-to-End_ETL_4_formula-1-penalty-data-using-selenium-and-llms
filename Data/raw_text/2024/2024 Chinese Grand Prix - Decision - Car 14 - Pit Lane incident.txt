Fact Pit Lane incident
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 34.8 of the Formula One Sporting Regulations and Appendix
L, Chapter IV, Article 5 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence and determined that Car 14 overtook Car 24 in the pit exit road and not
before pit exit. Car 14 formed up in the fast lane and maintained the order in which it
entered the fast lane until the pit exit, as required under Art.34.8 of the Sporting
Regulations. There was therefore no breach of the regulations and we took no further
action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
