Time 15:18
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 12:03
Session Sprint
Fact Incident between cars 14, 18, 4 & 44 in Turn 1.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No Further Action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence and determined that Cars 14, 18, 44 and 4 collided when they were
navigating Turn 1 of Lap 1. The collision resulted in damage to Car 14, 18 and
caused Car 4 to retire.
From the video evidence, it appeared that there were at least three collisions that
occurred â€“ the first between Cars 14 & 18 and then between Car 44 and Car 14 and
finally between Car 18 and Car 4. While it appeared to us that the incidents began
with Cars 14 & 18, the sudden and fast arrival of Car 44 contributed to the various
collisions. However, we were not able to identify one or more drivers wholly or
predominantly to blame for the various collisions or any one of them.
Also keeping in mind that this was in Turn 1 of Lap 1 where greater latitude is given to
drivers for incidents, we took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
