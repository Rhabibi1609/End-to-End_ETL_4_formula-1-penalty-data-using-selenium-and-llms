The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 16:57
Session Qualifying
Fact Allegedly driving unnecessarily slowly.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and timing evidence.
Despite the fact that Car 1 exited the pits slowly and made up a gap of approx. 14
seconds to the car in front of him, the Stewards determine that in this case no other
car was directly affected by this in their attempts to set a lap time. In addition to that, it
is noted that other cars were making similar gaps on track at this point in time.
However, as this type of incident could in different circumstances potentially prevent
other drivers from setting a lap time at the end of a session, the Stewards
recommend that consideration be given to setting a maximum gap time during
qualifying.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
