The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 10 - Pierre Gasly
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 14:51
Session Race
Fact Car 10 left the track at turn 15 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence.
Car 10 was overtaking Car 23 on the outside, was level with Car 23 at the apex but
fell back briefly prior to the exit of the turn. Therefore under the Driving Standards
Guidelines, Car 10 had lost the “right” to the corner. Accordingly as Car 10 left the
track and returned in front of Car 23, it is deemed to be a case of leaving the track
and gaining a lasting advantage.
A 5 second penalty is imposed instead of the 10 second penalty recommended in the
guidelines because the driver of Car 10 lost the right to the corner, albeit briefly, by
only a very small margin.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
