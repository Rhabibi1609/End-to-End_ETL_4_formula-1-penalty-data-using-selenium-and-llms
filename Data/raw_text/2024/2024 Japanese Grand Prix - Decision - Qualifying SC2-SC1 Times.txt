The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter
and determine the following:
Session Qualifying
Fact The car below exceeded the 1:53.0 time limit between the Safety Car lines.
No Car Driver Competitor Time of Day Lap
1 23 Alexander Albon Williams Racing 15:09.29 L4 (Q1)
Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 2, document 6)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-board
cameras and CCTV cameras.
The driver stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:53.0 around the
vast majority of the circuit. However, the Stewards determined that the driver took
appropriate actions to not impede 7 other drivers, and in all cases slowed down
significantly to allow those drivers to pass unimpeded. The Stewards therefore
determine that the driver concerned did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
