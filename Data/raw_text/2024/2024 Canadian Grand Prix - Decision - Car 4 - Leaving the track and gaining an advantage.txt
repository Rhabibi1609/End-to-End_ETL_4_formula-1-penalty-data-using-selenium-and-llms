Code and Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.

video evidence.
Car 4 left the track in turn 1 and returned to the track in the way prescribed in the
Race Director’s Event Notes. No position was gained by going off track and Car 4
was not defending his position when leaving the track.
The Stewards also reviewed the relative distances between Car 4 and Car 63 in front
as well as Car 81 behind. Whilst Car 4 slightly gained time on Car 63, the same
applies to Car 81 whereas Car 63 also lost time to Car 1 in front. Taking all this into
account, the Stewards take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
