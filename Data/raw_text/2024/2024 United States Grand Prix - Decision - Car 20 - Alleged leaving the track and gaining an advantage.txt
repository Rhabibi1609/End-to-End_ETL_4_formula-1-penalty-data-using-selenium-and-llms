Time 13:04
Session Sprint
Fact Car 20 left the track whilst Car 22 was attempting to overtake in Turn 11 on Lap 1.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence.
Car 22 was attempting to overtake Car 20 and was, according to the Driving
Standard Guidelines, in a position to do so, however after the apex the driver of Car
22 did not allow Car 20 “a fair and acceptable width..from the apex to the exit of the
corner” as specified in those Guidelines.
This resulted in Car 20 being forced to leave the track to avoid a collision. In doing
so, Car 20 retained its position.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
