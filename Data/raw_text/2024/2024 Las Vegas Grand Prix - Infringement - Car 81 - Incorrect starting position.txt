The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 22:02
Session Race
Fact Incorrect Starting Position.
InfringementBreach of Article 48.1 c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, and determined
that part of the contact patch of Car 81â€™s front tyres were outside the lines of the grid
box at the time of the Start Signal. This is a breach of Art 48.1.c of the FIA Formula
Sporting Regulations.
This attracts a mandatory time penalty under Art 54.3 of the Sporting Regulations.
Given the limited extent of the breach, we determined that a 5-second time penalty
was appropriate.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
