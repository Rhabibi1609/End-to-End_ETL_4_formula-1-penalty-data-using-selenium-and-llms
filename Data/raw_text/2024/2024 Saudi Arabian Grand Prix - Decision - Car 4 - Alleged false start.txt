Session Race
Fact Alleged false start.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 48.1 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and determined
that the video appeared to show that Car 4 moved before the start signal was given.
However, the FIA approved and supplied transponder fitted on the car did not indicate
a jump start.
Article 48.1 a) of the Formula One Sporting Regulations states clearly that the
judgment of whether or not there was a jump start is to be made in accordance with
the transponder, which did not show a jump start. In the circumstances, we took no
further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
