representative and reviewed video evidence and determined that Car 20 entered the
pit lane during the safety car period and did not change tyres as required under
Article 55.11 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.

for this particular infringement, in order to remain consistent with other infringements
of Article 55.11 of the Sporting Regulations, we impose a drive through penalty.
