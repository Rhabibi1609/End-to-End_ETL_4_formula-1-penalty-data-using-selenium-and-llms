The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 15:14
Session Race
Fact Release of Car 23 in an unsafe condition.
InfringementBreach of Article 34.14 d) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 10 second stop and go penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, CCTV and video from above the pit stop location,
team radio and in-car video evidence.
Albon stopped for a tyre change, then had to return to the pits to change tyres again,
having reported that the right front wheel was loose. The Stewards observed that the
front right wheel gun mechanic made an attempt to tighten the tyre, but then had to try
a second time, but by that point the car had left the pits. It was clear from the in-car
footage that the tyre was loose, which constitutes releasing in an unsafe condition
during a race. The ten second stop-go penalty is mandatory under the regulations.
The Stewards intend to investigate after the race whether the driver continued to
drive the car, knowing that it was released in an unsafe condition, which is an alleged
breach of Art. 34.14.e) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
