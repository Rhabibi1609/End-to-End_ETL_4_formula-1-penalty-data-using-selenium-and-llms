A fuel sample was taken from car numbers 44, 02 and 77 and analysed during the race.
An engine oil sample was taken from car numbers 44 and 23.
On the grid it was checked that all cars had fitted their tyres and the tyre heating blankets were
disconnected, when the “5-Minutes” signal was given.
On the grid the temperature of the LHS and RHS front and rear tyre was checked on car numbers
01, 18, 31, 10, 23, 02, 03, 77, 24 and 20.
On the grid the minimum tyre starting pressure of the LHS and RHS front and rear tyre was checked
on all cars.

The instantaneous fuel mass flow of all cars was checked.
The partial load fuel mass flow of all cars was checked.
The fuel temperature of all cars was checked.
The plenum temperature was checked on all cars.
The oil consumption was checked on all cars.
The exhaust fluid mass flow of all cars was checked.
The IVT temperatures were checked on all cars.
The ES state of charge on-track limits were checked on all cars.
The lap energy release and recovery limits were checked on all cars.
The MGU-K power limits were checked on all cars.
The maximum MGU-K speed was checked on all cars.
The maximum MGU-K torque was checked on all cars.
The maximum MGU-H speed was checked on all cars.

The torque control was checked on all cars.
The session type has been confirmed for all cars.
Chassis FIA checksum was checked on all cars taking part in the race.
The rear brakes pressure control was checked on all cars.
The brake temperature warnings were checked on all cars.
The steering wheel of car numbers 01, 11, 63, 16, 55, 81, 04, 18, 14, 31, 10, 23, 02, 03, 22, 77, 24,

It was checked that no car exceeded 80 km/h when leaving the formation grid prior to the start of the
race.
It was verified on all cars that the PCU dash display configuration was not changed during Parc
Fermé.
The tyre starting pressures of all cars during the race were checked.
Cold tyre pressures were checked on car number 31.
The tyres used by all drivers during the race today have been checked.
A fuel sample was taken from car number 16.
The fuel samples have been checked for density and analysed by gas chromatography.
The results of all the fuel analyses show that the fuels were the same as ones, which had been
approved for use by the relevant competitors prior to the Competition.
Further the density change of the fuel samples taken today was within the permitted limits.
An engine oil sample was taken from car number 16.
The engine oil samples have been analysed by FTIR spectroscopy and viscometry.
The results of the FTIR analyses show that the sampled oils were consistent with reference engine
oil samples which had been approved for use by the relevant competitors prior to the Competition.
After the race car number 16 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more extensive
physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the Auxiliary Oil Tank (AOT) as well as all attached
sensors, their loom routing and connections to the SECU and other units.
Apart from the weight of car number 63 (see Document 42), all car weights, and the items checked
were found to be in conformity with the 2024 FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.
