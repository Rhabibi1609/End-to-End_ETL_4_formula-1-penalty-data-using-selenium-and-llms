No / Driver 63 - George Russell
Competitor Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team
Time 15:52
Session Race
Fact Car 81 left the track between Turns 16 and 17 and rejoined in front of Car 63.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), the driver of Car 63
(George Russell), team representatives and reviewed external and in-car video
evidence.
This incident provided a number of challenges in arriving at a decision.
There are a number of matters that, based on the “level of comfort” criteria used by
the International Court of Appeal in accepting evidence, we accept as fact:
1. That the driver of Car 63 did not “dive in” and was in control at the entry to Turn 16.
2. That coming into Turn 16 Car 63’s front axle was in front of the mirrors of Car 81
hence according to the driving standards, Car 63 was entitled to “racing room” on
Turn 16.
3. That Car 63 bounced off the inside kerb and then collided with Car 81 (based on
photographic evidence tabled by Car 81).
4. That the driver of Car 81, having felt the impact from Car 63, took evasive action
by driving off the track rather than risking another collision with perhaps more serious
consequences.
5. That the driver of Car 63 left sufficient room on the exit of Turn 16 for Car 81 to
take the turn remaining on track.
6. That Car 81 cut the chicane and returned safely to the track in front of Car 63.
The driving standards are however silent on what action is required of a driver who
leaves the track to avoid a collision or is forced off, safely rejoins the track and
retains position.
Not that this is a determining point, we note that both drivers and team
representatives agreed this incident did not warrant the imposition of any penalty.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
