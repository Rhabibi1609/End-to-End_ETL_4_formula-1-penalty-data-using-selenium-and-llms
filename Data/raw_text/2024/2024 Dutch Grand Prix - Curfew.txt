Last night team personnel of the Williams Racing team, who are associated with the operation of the
car, were within the confines of the circuit during the fourteen (14) hour period which commenced at
18:30 on 22 August, eighteen (18) hours before the scheduled start time of P1 and ends four (4)
hours before the scheduled start time of P1 at 08:30 on 23 August.
This was the first of the three (3) individual exceptions permitted for the Williams Racing team during
