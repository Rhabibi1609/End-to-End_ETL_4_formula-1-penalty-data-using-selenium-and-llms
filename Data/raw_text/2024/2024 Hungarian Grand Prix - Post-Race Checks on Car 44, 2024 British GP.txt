Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race of the British GP, car number 44 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for
more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the complete ICE air intake system including a thorough
physical inspection of the engine plenum and the charge air cooler as well as all sensors related to
the system, their loom routing and connections to the SECU and other units.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2024 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
