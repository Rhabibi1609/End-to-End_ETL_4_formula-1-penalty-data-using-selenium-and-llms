The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 63 & 64)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 3 - Daniel Ricciardo
Competitor Visa Cash App RB F1 Team
Time 15:54
Session Race
Fact Car 3 overtaking Car 27 under Safety Car conditions.
InfringementBreach of Article 55.8 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next race in which the driver participates.
2 penalty points (total of 2 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 3​​ (Daniel Ricciardo), the driver of Car 2​​ 7
(Nico Hulkenberg), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling
system data, video, timing, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that
Car 3 overtook Car 27 while the race was under Safety Car conditions.
The driver of Car 3 admitted that he overtook Car 27 deliberately but he explained
that he felt that he could do so because Car 27 had overtaken him under safety car
before on Lap 28. We note that Car 27 was permitted to overtake Car 3 on Lap 28
because of Article 55.8.
There was no justifiable basis for Car 3 to overtake Car 27 while the race was under
Safety Car conditions. We accordingly imposed a 10 second time penalty on Car 3.
As Car 3 was unable to serve the penalty due to retirement, we imposed a 3-grid
place penalty to Car 3 for the next race in which the driver participates.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
