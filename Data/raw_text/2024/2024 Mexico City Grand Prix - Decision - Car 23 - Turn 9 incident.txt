Time 14:30
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 13 & 14)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 12:52
Session Practice 1
Fact Incident with Car 38 in turn 9.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 23 (Alexander Albon), the driver of Car 38
(Oliver Bearman), team representatives and reviewed, video, telemetry, team radio
and in-car video evidence.
Bearman was on a cool down lap with the team letting him know about cars behind.
Albon was on a fast lap. Just after Turn 9, Bearman, who was recharging and thus
going relatively slow, pulled to the right. When Albon came around T9, he had
Bearman in front of him and lifted. Because the car was under significant loading in
the corner, it caused him to oversteer.
Both drivers agreed that Bearman’s positioning was not unreasonable, but was
unfortunate as it was close to Albon’s line. Had Bearman been slightly further down
the track it would not have resulted in an incident. All parties agreed that it was a
racing incident.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
