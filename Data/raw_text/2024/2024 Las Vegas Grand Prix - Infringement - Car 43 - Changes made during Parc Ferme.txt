DL)
The front brake cooling ducts have been changed while under Parc Ferme.
InfringementBreach of Articles 29.2 and 40.9 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Required to start the Race from the pit lane.
Reason The RNC used are in excess of the permitted number for the 2024 Championship
season. This is a breach of Article 29.2 and incurs a grid penalty.
Additionally, Williams Racing changed the front brake cooling ducts of Car 43 under
Parc Ferme with the approval of the Technical Delegate in accordance with Article
40.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
However, the parts are different from the ones originally used, which is a breach of
Article 40.9 and Car 43 is required to start the Race from pit lane.
Due to the fact that the car is required to start from the pit lane, the grid penalty does
not come into effect.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
