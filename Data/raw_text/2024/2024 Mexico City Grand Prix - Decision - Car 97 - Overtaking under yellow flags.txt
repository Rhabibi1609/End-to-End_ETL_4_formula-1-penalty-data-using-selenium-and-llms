The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 12) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 97 - Robert Shwartzman
Competitor Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber
Time 12:52
Session Practice 1
Fact Overtaking under yellow flags.
InfringementBreach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 5 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 97 (Robert Shwartzman), team
representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, team radio
and in-car video evidence.
Following the incident at T9 Shwartzman passed a single waved yellow, and a double
yellow flag before overtaking Tsunoda in the yellow zone while traveling at speed.
The penalty is the usual penalty for passing under a double yellow, and while the
Stewards recognize that the driver is not scheduled to start the race, they have
applied the consistent penalty.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
