The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 3 - Daniel Ricciardo
Competitor Visa Cash App RB F1 Team
Time 15:19
Session Race
Fact A mechanic worked on the car whilst it was serving a time penalty during a pit stop.
InfringementBreach of Article 54.4 c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
When Car 3 stopped in the Pit Box, a mechanic at the front right was noted to have
touched the car then withdrew his hand and the car then served the mandatory time
penalty. However the regulations prescribes that “touching” the car is deemed to be
“working on the car”. Save for the touching of the car, the Stewards consider that the
original time penalty was served but not correctly and this new penalty is applied in
respect to that “working on the car” breach.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
