The Stewards have received a petition for a Right of Review in accordance with Article 14 of the FIA
International Sporting Code, from McLaren Formula 1 Team, in respect of the Decision of the
Stewards of the 2024 United States Grand Prix, Document 69, breach of Article 33.3 of the FIA
Formula One Sporting Regulations in relation to Car 4.
The team representative is required to attend a video conference with the Stewards at 1430 hrs
Mexico time on Friday October 25, 2024 in relation to the above. Any other “concerned party” may
seek the permission of the Stewards to appear.
It should be noted that this Hearing will be in two parts. The first part will be to hear evidence as to
whether or not there is a “significant and relevant new element which was unavailable to the party
seeking the Review at the time of the Decision concerned”.
Should the Stewards determine, in accordance with Article 14.3, (in their sole discretion) that such
element exists, a second part of the Hearing will be convened at a time to be advised.
