Time 14:40
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 13:10
Session Sprint
Fact Car 81, in overtaking Car 10 in Turn 12, forced Car 10 off the track at the exit of the
corner.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence.
The Driving Standard Guidelines provide that when overtaking on the inside the driver
must not force the other car off the track and must leave a fair and acceptable width
for the car being overtaken. This did not occur on this occasion.
However in mitigation, a 5 second penalty is imposed instead of the standard 10
second penalty because the Stewards determine that the forcing off track was not
deliberate, and the driver of Car 81 was in control of the car at all times.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
