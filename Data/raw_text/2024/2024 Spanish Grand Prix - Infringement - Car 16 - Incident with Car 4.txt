From The Stewards Document 30
To The Team Manager, Date 22 June 2024
Scuderia Ferrari
Time 15:48
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 26 & 27)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 16 - Charles Leclerc
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 13:19
Session Practice 3
Fact Incident between Cars 16 and 4.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving).
This is the driverâ€™s 1st reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 16 (Charles Leclerc), the driver of Car 4
(Lando Norris), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car
video evidence.
The driver of Car 16 stated that he got impeded by Car 4 into Turn 5 and that upset
him. He then had to abort his flying lap and contended that, while trying to get off the
racing line before Turn 7, he misjudged the position of his car and made slight contact
with Car 4.
Irrespective of any possible intent, the Stewards consider the move made by Car 16,
whilst not being dangerous, to be erratic and therefore issue a driving reprimand in
line with precedents.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
