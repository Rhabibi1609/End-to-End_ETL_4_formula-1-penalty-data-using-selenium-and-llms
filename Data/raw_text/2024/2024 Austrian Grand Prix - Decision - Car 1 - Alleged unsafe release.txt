The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 15:30
Session Race
Fact Alleged unsafe release of Car 1.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
Car 1 was released from its pit stop station when Car 4 was approaching. There is a
possibility that Car 1 hindered Car 4 on its approach to the pit stop. However, Article
34.14 a) specifies that a car is considered to be released in an unsafe manner if it
could endanger pit lane personnel or another driver. This was not the case and
therefore no further action is taken.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
