Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
The uppermost rear wing element adjustable positions were checked on car numbers 20 and 27. The
LHS and RHS outermost area of the of the adjustable elements were exceeding the maximum
allowed 85mm on both cars. As this is not in compliance with TR Article 3.10.10 h), I am referring this
matter to the stewards for their consideration.
