The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 13:29
Session Practice 3
Fact Alleged failure to follow the Race Director’s Event Notes regarding the escape road
instructions at turn 14.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-
compliance with Race Director’s Event Note (item 15, document 4).
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video in-car video evidence.
The driver of Car 81 did not follow the Race Director’s instructions concerning turn
14, but the Stewards determine that he left the track at the apex of turn 13 because
his entry into the turn 13/14 section was significantly impacted by Car 63 and
therefore he did not have sufficient time to react. Given the fact that he rejoined in a
safe manner, no further action is warranted.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
