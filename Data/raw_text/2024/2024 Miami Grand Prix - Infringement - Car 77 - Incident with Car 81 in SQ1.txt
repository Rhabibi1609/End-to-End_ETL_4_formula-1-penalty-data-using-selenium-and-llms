Time 20:10
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 18 & 19)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 77 - Valtteri Bottas
Competitor Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber
Time 16:37
Session Sprint Qualifying
Fact Incident between Cars 77 and 81 at 16:37.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Sprint session in which the driver participates per
Article 37.4 b).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), the driver of Car 77
(Valtteri Bottas), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined
that the driver of Car 77 unnecessarily impeded Car 81 during the Sprint Qualifying.
On the straight before Turn 1, Car 77 was being driven slowly on the racing line after
finishing a fast lap, while Car 81 was approaching on a fast lap. Car 81 and Car 77
needed to take evasive action to avoid a collision.
The primary responsibility rests with the driver to ensure that he does not place
himself in a position whereby he unnecessarily impedes another driver. Here Car 77
was driving slowly on the racing line and caused to the situation that ensued.
However, during the hearing both team and driver of Car 77 admitted that the team
had not warned the driver of Car 77 that Car 81 was approaching on a fast lap. That
was obviously an error on the teamâ€™s part and contributed significantly to the incident.
In light of the above, we impose a penalty of a drop of 3 grid positions at the race.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
