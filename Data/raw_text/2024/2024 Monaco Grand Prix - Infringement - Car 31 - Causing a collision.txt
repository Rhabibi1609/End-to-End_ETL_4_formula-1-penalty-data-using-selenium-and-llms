The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 31 - Esteban Ocon
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 15:04
Session Race
Fact Collision between Car 31 & Car 10 in Turn 8.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty, converted to a drop of 5 grid positions for the next Race in
which the driver participates.
2 penalty points (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence and determined that Car 31
attempted to overtake Car 10 at Turn 8. The attempt resulted in the cars coming
together, Car 31 being flung into the air and damaging the car.
As the race was red flagged shortly thereafter, the cars returned to the pits and Car
31 retired. It was clear to us that the collision was caused solely by the overly
ambitious overtaking attempt, from too far back, by Car 31 and was therefore wholly
to blame for the incident.
The baseline penalty for causing a collision in this season is a 10 second time
penalty. This is what we imposed on Car 31. However, given that Car 31 did not finish
the race, it will be converted to a drop of 5 grid positions for the next race in which the
driver participates.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
