The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 39) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 27 - Nico Hulkenberg
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 16:29
Session Qualifying
Fact Pit lane incident.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 5 b) of the International Sporting
Code and non-compliance with the Race Directorâ€™s Event Note (item 11, document
16).
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 27 (Nico Hulkenberg), team
representative and reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
The Stewards determine that at the time Car 27 entered the fast lane there was no
suitable gap to blend in. However, this was caused by another car stopping right in
front of Car 27 at the moment the driver wanted to do so. The Stewards conclude that
the driver started to merge into the fast lane anticipating that there would be a suitable
gap but this was prevented by the other car stopping at exactly this moment.
Therefore no further action is taken.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
