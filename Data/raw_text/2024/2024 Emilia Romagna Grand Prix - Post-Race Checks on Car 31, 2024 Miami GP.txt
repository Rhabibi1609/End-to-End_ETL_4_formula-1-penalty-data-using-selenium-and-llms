Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race of the Miami GP, car number 31 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for
more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the front and rear corner components such as front and
rear drums, front and rear scoops, front and rear internal cooling ducts, front and rear drum
deflectors, front and rear suspension uprights, front and rear brake calipers and front and rear brake
discs.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2024 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
