Fact Car 24 impeding Car 1 in turn 17 at 16:12.
InfringementBreach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 24 (Zhou Guanyu), the driver of Car 1
(Max Verstappen), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling
system data, video, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence.
Car 24 stayed on the racing line through Turn 17 when Car 1 was closing in despite
not going at full racing speed. Car 1 had to lift the throttle for a brief moment before
passing Car 24.
The Stewards acknowledge that team informed the driver about Car 1 being behind
him, but the information given was not accurate enough. However, it is the
responsibility of the driver to not unnecessarily impede other drivers. The Stewards
determine that Car 24 did unnecessarily impede Car 1 and therefore the standard
penalty is applied.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
