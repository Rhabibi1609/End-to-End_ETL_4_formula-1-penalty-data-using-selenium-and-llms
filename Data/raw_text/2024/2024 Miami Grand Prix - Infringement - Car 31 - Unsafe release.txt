The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 31 - Esteban Ocon
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 11:30
Session Sprint
Fact Unsafe release of Car 31 and collision with Car 16 in the pit lane.
InfringementBreach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
1 penalty points (total of 1 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed external video evidence and observed that Car 31 left its
garage to commence the reconnaissance lap and collided with Car 16 in the pit lane.
From the video evidence, it appeared that the driver was not released by the team
representative (the number 1). In fact, the video shows the number 1 trying to tell him
to stop. The driver nevertheless left the garage and the collision ensued.
We considered that what happened was more serious than some of the precedents
given that the driver was not released and that there was a resulting collision.
We therefore impose a 10 second penalty with one penalty point to the driver.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
