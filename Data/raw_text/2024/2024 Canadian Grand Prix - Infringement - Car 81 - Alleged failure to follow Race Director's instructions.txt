Fact Failure to follow the Race Director’s Event Notes regarding the escape road
instructions at turn 14.
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Director’s Event Note (item 15, document 4).
Decision Warning.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), team representative
and reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
The driver of Car 81 left the track at turn 14, did not touch the orange kerb on the
inside and did not follow the instructions outlined in item 15 of the Race Director’s
Event Notes. However, the Stewards determine that, given the weather conditions,
the driver took reasonable action not to rejoin the track in an unsafe manner and did
not gain any lasting advantage and therefore consider a Warning as appropriate.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
