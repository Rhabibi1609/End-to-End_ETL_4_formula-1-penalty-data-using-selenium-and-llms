2024 CHINESE GRAND PRIX
19 - 21 April 2024
From The Stewards Document 78
To The Team Manager, Date 30 April 2024
Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 13:45
The Stewards have received a petition for a Right of Review in accordance with Article 14 of the FIA
International Sporting Code, from Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team on 23 April 2024 in respect of the
decision of the Stewards of the 2024 Chinese Grand Prix, Document 40 (alleged breach of Appendix
L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the International Sporting Code in relation to Car 14).
The team representative is required to report to the Stewards on Friday, May 03, 2024 at 08:00 EDT
(14:00 CEST) in relation to the above. The hearing will be held virtually via video conference, details
of which will be provided by separate communication.
It should be noted that this hearing will be held in two parts: The first part will be to hear evidence as
to whether there is a “significant and relevant new element which was unavailable to the party
seeking the Review at the time of the decision concerned.”
Should the Stewards determine, in accordance with Article 14.3 of the FIA International Sporting
Code, that such an element exists, a second part of the hearing will be convened at a time to be
advised. Any other “concerned party” may seek the permission of the Stewards to be present for the
second part of the hearing, should one be convened.
