Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Aston Martin Aramco Formula One Team, who are associated with
the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the twelve and a half (12.5)
hour period which commenced at 20:00 on 05 April, fifteen and a half (15.5) hours before the
scheduled start time of P3 and ends three (3) hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 08:30
on 06 April.
This was the first of the two (2) individual exceptions permitted for the Aston Martin Aramco Formula
One Team during the 2024 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be
taken.
