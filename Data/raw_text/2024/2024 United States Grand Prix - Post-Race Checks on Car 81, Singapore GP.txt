Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race in Singapore, car number 81 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more
extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the homologated gearbox and component classification,
the gearbox dimensions, the gear ratios and the UIIL submission for the inspected RNC assembly.
All inspected components and items were found to be in conformance with the 2024 Formula One
Technical Regulations.
