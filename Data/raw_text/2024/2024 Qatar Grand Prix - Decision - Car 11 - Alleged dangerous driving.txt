The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 20:06
Session Race
Fact The driver of Car 11 drove his car across the track into the path of oncoming cars.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 e) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, telemetry and video
evidence.
Car 11 spun and stopped sideways on the right hand side of the track. The driver
then appeared to drive directly across the track at right angles to the oncoming traffic.
However the evidence tabled showed that the driver attempted to do a rapid 90
degree clockwise spin but in doing so, experienced clutch failure which resulted in the
car travelling across the track. Whilst this appeared potentially dangerous from the
video, the attempted move by the driver was possible to execute under normal
circumstances and only the failure of the clutch caused the reported incident.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
