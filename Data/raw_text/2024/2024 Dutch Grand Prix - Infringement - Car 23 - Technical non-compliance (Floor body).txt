Session Qualifying
Fact Floor body found to lie outside the regulatory volume.
InfringementBreach of Article 3.5.1 a) of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.
Decision Car 23 is disqualified from the qualifying. All other cars move up in the classification.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representatives of Car 23 (Alexander Albon), the
FIA Technical Delegate, the FIA Scrutineer conducting the measurement of the car
and the FIA Single Seater Director.
The floor body of Car 23 was found to lie outside the regulatory volume mentioned in
Article 3.5.1 a) of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.
The team did not dispute the calibration of the FIA measuring system and the
measurement of the car, but stated that their own measurements have produced
different results.
The Stewards determine that the result of the measurement conducted with the FIA
system in Parc Ferme is the relevant one and the due process prescribed by the
regulations has been followed. Therefore the standard penalty for such an
infringement is applied.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
