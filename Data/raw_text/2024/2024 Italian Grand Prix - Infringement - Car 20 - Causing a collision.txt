The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 20 - Kevin Magnussen
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 15:29
Session Race
Fact Car 20 collided with Car 10 at the entry to turn 4.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 12 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed video and in-car video evidence.
On the approach to Turn 4, Car 20 attempted to overtake Car 10 on the inside.
Whilst Car 20 had its front axle past the mirror of Car 10, the Driving Standards
Guidelines specify that an overtaking car has to “be driven in a safe and controlled
manner throughout the manoeuvre”. The Stewards determined that this was not the
case for Car 20 and hence the driver was wholly to blame for the collision and hence
the standard penalty and penalty points are allocated.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
