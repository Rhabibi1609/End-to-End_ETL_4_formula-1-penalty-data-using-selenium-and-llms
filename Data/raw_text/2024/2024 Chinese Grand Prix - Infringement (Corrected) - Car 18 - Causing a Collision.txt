The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 15:51
Session Race
Fact Car 18 collided with Car 3 at Turn 14.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 7 for the 12 month period)
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing and in-car
video evidence and determined that Car 18 collided with Car 3 at Turn 14. The cars
were all travelling slowly to set up for the restart of the race towards the end of a
safety car period. The car in front of Car 18 slowed to take the corner and also to try
to match the pace of the group of cars in front of it. Car 18 then collided with Car 3.
We determined that Car 18 ought to have anticipated the pace of the cars in front,
particularly Car 3 and should have prepared to brake accordingly. Had it done that, it
would have avoided the collision. Hence Car 18 was predominantly to blame for the
collision that ultimately led to Car 3 having to retire from the race.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
