Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 14:51
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 13 & 14)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 37 - Isack Hadjar
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 13:29
Session Practice 1
Fact Car 37 unnecessarily impeding Car 4 in turn 2.
InfringementBreach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Formal warning for the driver.
The competitor (Oracle Red Bull Racing) is fined â‚¬20,000.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 37 (Isack Hadjar), the driver of Car 4
(Lando Norris), team representatives and reviewed video, team radio and in-car
video evidence.
It was obvious that the driver was not given timely and appropriate warning of the
approach of Car 4. The driver of Car 4 was forced to brake heavily and leave the
track to avoid a collision. The Team of Car 37 conceded that it had not provided the
necessary advice to its driver.
The Stewards note that the penalty on the competitor is higher that that imposed for
another impeding incident in this session. The reason for this is that this incident was
regarded as more serious.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
