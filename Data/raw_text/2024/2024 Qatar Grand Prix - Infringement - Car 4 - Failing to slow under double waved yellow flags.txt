The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 19:48
Session Race
Fact Car 4 failed to slow for double waved yellow flags.
InfringementBreach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code and non-
compliance with Race Directorâ€™s Event Notes (item 1, document 3).
Decision 10 second stop and go penalty.
3 penalty points (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry
and in-car video evidence.
The telemetry and on-board audio clearly showed that the driver of Car 4 did not
make any reduction in speed in the yellow sector. The double waved yellow flags and
yellow lights were clearly visible to him.
Compliance with the yellow flag rules is paramount for the safety of all parties and this
requirement is clearly noted in the first item of the Race Director's Event Notes at
every event.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
