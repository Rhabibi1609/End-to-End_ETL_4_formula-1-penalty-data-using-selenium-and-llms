To The Team Manager, Date 22 June 2024
Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 15:38
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 24 & 25)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 13:18
Session Practice 3
Fact Incident between Cars 18 and 44.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving).
This is the driverâ€™s 1st reprimand of the season
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 44
(Lewis Hamilton), team representatives and reviewed video and in-car video as well
as team radio evidence.
The driver of Car 18 stated that he got impeded by Car 44 into Turn 5 and that upset
him. He admitted that he wanted to express his displeasure to the other driver by
pulling over on him at the exit. Both cars made slight contact which was incidental.
However, the Stewards consider the move made by Car 18, whilst not being
dangerous, to be erratic and therefore issue a driving reprimand in line with
precedents.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
