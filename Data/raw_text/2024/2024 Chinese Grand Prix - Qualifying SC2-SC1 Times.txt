The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter
and determine the following:
Session Qualifying
Fact The car below exceeded the 2:01.0 time limit between the Safety Car lines.
No Car Driver Competitor Time of Day Lap
1 2 Logan Sargeant Williams Racing 15:18:32 8 (Q1)
Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 2, document 29)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras.
The driver concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 2:01.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, the driver spun out and left the
track, resulting in the non-compliance. The Stewards therefore determine that the
driver concerned did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and that evidently the
reason they were above the maximum time was due to him leaving the track.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
