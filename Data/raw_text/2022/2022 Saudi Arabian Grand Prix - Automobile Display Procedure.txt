In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the Sporting regulations,
please note the following procedures for the Car Display at this event:
• Between 15:30 and 16:30 on Friday, one car from each team must be
positioned as shown in the attached drawing, with the other car positioned
and available for viewing inside your garage.
• The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop
practice is taking place the car must return to the same position.
• At any event where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to
leave the cars in position and use your grid easy-ups.
• There must be enough space around the car on display to allow people to
move safely.
• The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and
avoid overlapping of any presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to
hold (any presentations are not mandatory on Friday):

used by all teams to maximise efficiency.
