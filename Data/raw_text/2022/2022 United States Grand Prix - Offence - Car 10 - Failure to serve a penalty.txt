The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 10 - Pierre Gasly
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 14:41
Session Race
Fact Car 10 failed to properly serve a penalty.
Offence Breach of Article 54.4 c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 10 second time penalty
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that Car 10 came into the
pit lane and stopped. The front wheels were lifted at 4.54 seconds and rear wheels at
4.8 seconds. This is a breach of the regulations, however not significant enough to
warrant disqualification. As this was a team error, no driver penalty points are
allocated.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
