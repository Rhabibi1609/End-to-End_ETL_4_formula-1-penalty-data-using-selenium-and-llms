2022 AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX
7 - 10 April 2022
From The FIA Formula One Technical Delegate Document 49
To The Stewards Date 09 April 2022
Time 19:13
Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the qualifying practice session it was checked on car number 23 whether a 1.0 litre sample plus
the amount of fuel necessary to drive the car back to the pits under its own power (0.15 litres
required for this from the position where he stopped) could be taken from the car. It was possible to
take only a 0.33 litre sample following the procedures layed out in Article 6.5.4 of the 2022 Formula
One Technical Regulations.
Therefore I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration, as this is not in
compliance with Article 6.5.2 of the 2022 Formula One Technical Regulations.
