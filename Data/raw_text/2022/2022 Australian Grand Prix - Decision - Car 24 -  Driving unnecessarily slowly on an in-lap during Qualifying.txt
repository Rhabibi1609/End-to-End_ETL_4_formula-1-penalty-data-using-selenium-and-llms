2022 AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX
7 - 10 April 2022
From The Stewards Document 59
To The Team Manager, Date 09 April 2022
Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 22:24
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 54) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 16:09
Session Qualifying
Fact Alleged driving unnecessarily slowly on an in-lap during Qualifying.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
failing to observe the Race Director’s Note (Document 34).
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 24 (Zhou Guanyu) and team
representative and reviewed timing evidence.
During the lap there was heavy traffic and ZHO took effort to ensure that he did not
impede other drivers on push laps. These efforts slowed his lap time. As a result, the
minimum time was slightly breached. The Stewards accept the driver’s rationale for
his actions; find that he acted reasonably under the circumstances; and, therefore,
take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
