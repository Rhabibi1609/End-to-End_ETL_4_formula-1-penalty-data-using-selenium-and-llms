Session Race
Fact Car 24 overtook Car 23 by braking late and leaving the track at Turn 1 thereby
gaining a lasting advantage.
Offence Breach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty
1 penalty point (total of 1 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that Car 24 attempted an
overtake on Car 23 by braking very late. In doing so, he locked up and was not able to
remain on the track and he left the track to maintain his position. In doing so, he
gained a lasting advantage and remained ahead of Car 23. The advantage was not
negated by giving the position back at the earliest available opportunity or at all.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
