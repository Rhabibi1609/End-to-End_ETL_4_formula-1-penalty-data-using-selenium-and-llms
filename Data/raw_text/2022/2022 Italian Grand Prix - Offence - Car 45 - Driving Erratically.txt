Time 18:10
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (Document 61) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 45 - Nyck de Vries
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 16:15
Session Race
Fact Car 45 braked heavily under the Safety Car between Turns 2 and 3, when being
closely followed by Car 24.
Offence Breach of Appendix L, Ch IV, Article 2 e) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Reprimand (driving)
This is the driver’s first Reprimand of the Season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 45 (Nyck de Vries), the team
representative and have reviewed video, audio and telemetry evidence.
The driver advised that after the second lap under the Safety Car he was unsure
about why his display was showing that he was at risk of being under the delta time. At
the same time, he was dealing with brake issues and was in radio contact with the
Team over this issue, so did not get any advice from the Team in relation to his delta.
He therefore reduced speed in order to remain above the delta time.
The Stewards took note of the fact that the driver was a “last minute” replacement for
the usual team driver and had driven this car for the first time in FP3 at this event.
Therefore, in mitigation the Stewards decide to impose the penalty of a Reprimand
instead of a higher penalty.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
