2022 BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIX
10 - 13 November 2022
From The Stewards Document 39
To The Team Manager, Date 12 November 2022
BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 19:17
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 34 and 35)
and heard from the drivers and the team representative, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 14 - Fernando Alonso
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 16:34
Session Sprint
Fact Pit straight incident between cars 31 and 14.
Offence Breach of Appendix L Chapter IV 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty imposed after the Sprint.
(5 seconds added to elapsed Sprint time).
2 penalty points (total of 6 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 14 (Fernando Alonso), the driver of Car
31 (Esteban Ocon), the team representative and have reviewed video and telemetry
evidence.
Alonso started a pass on car 31 at turn 15. The team noted that Ocon was unusually
slow because of the aero damage due to the incident at turn 4, however the Stewards
determined via telemetry that Ocon was at similar speeds to other cars at the same
point on the track that were not in a tow. Alonso, however, was significantly faster as
he had the tow, and – as he admitted in the hearing – slightly misjudged the time to pull
out and struck Ocon from behind, his front wing striking Ocon’s rear tyre. The
Stewards found that Alonso was wholly at fault for the collision, which at those speeds
and at that location on the track was dangerous.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
