The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 15:14
Session Race
Fact Causing a collision
Offence Breach of Appendix L Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty
2 penalty points (total of 7 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video from several angles, including In Car Cameras,
CCTV and broadcast video.
The Stewards determined that Verstappen attempted to pass Hamilton on the outside
of turn 1 by braking very late. He did not complete the pass in Turn 1 and his excess
speed compromised his entry into turn 2, at which point he made contact with
Hamilton. While the Stewards recognize that Hamilton could possibly have given a
little more room at the apex of turn 2, the Stewards determined that Verstappen was
predominantly at fault.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
