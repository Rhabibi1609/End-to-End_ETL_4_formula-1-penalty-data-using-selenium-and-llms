Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the McLaren F1 Team, who are associated with the operation of the
car, were within the confines of the circuit during the fourteen hour period which commenced at
18:00 on 06 October, eighteen hours before the scheduled start time of P1 and ends four hours
before the scheduled start time of P1 at 08:00 on 07 October.
This was the third of the six individual exceptions permitted for the McLaren F1 Team during the
2022 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
