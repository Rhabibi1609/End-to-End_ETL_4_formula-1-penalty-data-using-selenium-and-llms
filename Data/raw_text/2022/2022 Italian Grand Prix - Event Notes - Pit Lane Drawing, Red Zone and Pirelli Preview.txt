Tyres notes
• Not permitted to switch tyres from their originally allocated position. • Heating time temperature limits apply to the actual tyre surface
temperature measured with the IR gun as detailed in the TD003
• Do not subject tyres to large deformation or heavy impact.
• Cold cooling curve temperature limits apply to the tyre side wall
• Do not leave fitted tyres exposed at an air temperature lower than 15°C temperature measured with the probe as detailed in TD003
and/or any UV emission.
• BLANKET HEATING TIME for each temperature range to be counted from
• Revised prescriptions could be issued during the race weekend in the moment the blanket control unit is set to reach its targeted temperature
accordance with TD003. within its correspondent interval.
General notes
Teams are kindly reminded that the following will be subject to FIA checks during the event:
• Starting pressures
• Cold pressures (according to the cold pressure cooling curves)
• Re-heat pressures
• EOS Camber
• Maximum tyre temperatures in blankets
• Tyre swapping
