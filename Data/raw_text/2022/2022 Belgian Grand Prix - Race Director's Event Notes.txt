EVENT NOTES
General Instructions
1) Track light panels
The FIA track light panels have been installed in the positions shown on the circuit map. In
accordance with Appendix H to the ISC the light signals have the same meaning as flag signals.
2) Drivers leaving their pit stop position in the pit lane
For safety reasons, no car should be driven from its pit stop position at any time unless:
a) It has first been driven into the pit stop position having just entered the pit lane from the track,
and;
b) It is then driven immediately back onto the track from the pit stop position.
3) Observing yellow flags during free practice and qualifying
3.1 Double waved: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow marshalling sector must reduce
speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop. In order for the stewards to be
satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements it must be clear that he has not
attempted to set a meaningful lap time, for practical purposes any driver in a double yellow sector
will have that lap time deleted.
3.2 Single waved: Drivers should reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction. It must be
clear that a driver has reduced speed and, in order for this to be clear, a driver would be expected
to have braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant marshalling sector.
4) Laps during qualifying and reconnaissance laps
4.1 In order to ensure that cars are not driven unnecessarily slowly on in laps during and after the end
of qualifying or during reconnaissance laps when the pit exit is opened for the race, drivers must stay
below the maximum time set by the FIA between the Safety Car lines shown on the pit lane map.
You will be informed of the maximum time after the second free practice session.
5) Article 55.14
(…) In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the
point at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves no
erratic acceleration or braking nor any manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede
the restart.(…)

6) Parc Fermé Cameras
The Parc Fermé cameras must be uncovered and operational at all times during the Event.
7) Lapping during the race
The ISC requires drivers who are caught by another car about to lap him to allow the faster driver
past at the first available opportunity. The F1 Marshalling System has been developed in order to
ensure that the point at which a driver is shown blue flags is consistent, rather than trusting the ability
of marshals to identify situations that require blue flags.
The system will be set to give a pre-warning when the faster car is within 3.0s of the car about to be
lapped, this should be used by the team of the slower car to warn their driver he is soon going to be
lapped and that allowing the faster car through should be considered a priority. When the faster car
is within 1.2s of the car about to be lapped blue flags will be shown to the slower car (in addition to
blue light panels, blue cockpit lights and a message on the timing monitors) and the driver must allow
the following driver to overtake at the first available opportunity.
It should be noted that the aim of using F1MS is ensure consistent application of the rules, additional
instructions may also be given by race control when necessary.

11) Positioning of the car on track during Free Practices and Qualifying
In the event of fast approaching cars, drivers are permitted to go offline after Turn 16 until before
Turn 18 to avoid any high-speed differential between the cars on track.
12) Practice starts
12.1 Practice starts may be carried out on the RHS of the pit exit road after Turn 1 and before the SC2
line. During this time any driver passing a car which has stopped to carry out a practice start may
cross the white line that is referred to in 13.1 below.
12.2 For reasons of safety and sporting equity, cars may not stop in the fast lane at any time the pit exit
is open without a justifiable reason (a practice start is not considered a justifiable reason).
12.3 For reasons of safety and sporting equity, at any time the pit exit is open, and practice starts are
permitted to be carried out, any driver who wishes to perform a practice start must form up in a line
and leave in the order they got there unless another car is unduly delayed.
12.4 Practice starts may be carried out on the track at the end of each free practice session, none may
be carried out in the pit lane. Any car on the track when the chequered flag is shown may then
complete another lap and, instead of entering the pits, proceed to the grid and carry out a practice
start.
12.5 All drivers carrying out a practice start must do so by pulling as far forward on the grid as possible
and, if necessary, should wait for others to carry out a start before getting to a grid position further
forward. Under no circumstances should a driver make a practice start if another car is still stationary
in front of him on the same side of the grid.
12.6 If any driver appears to be disregarding any of the above a red flag will be displayed and the
possibility to carry out any further starts will be immediately terminated.
13) Lines at the Pit Entry and Pit Exit
13.1 In accordance with Chapter 4, Article 4 and 5 of Appendix L to the ISC drivers must follow the
procedures at pit entry and pit exit.
14) DRS
DRS Detection will be automatically disabled in each individual zone if any of the light panels in that
particular zone are displaying yellow. The zones and corresponding light panels are as follows:
a) DRS Activation 1: Panels 5, 6, 7
b) DRS Activation 2: Panels 19, 1, 2
15) Track Limits
In accordance with the provisions of Article 33.3, the white lines define the track edges. During
Qualifying and the Race, each time a driver fails to negotiate with the track limits, this will result in
that lap time being invalidated by the Stewards.
16) Fire extinguishers around the circuit
Indicated by white boards with a red fire extinguisher image attached to the debris fences and
barriers.

17) Places where drivers may leave the track
Indicated by orange painted openings in the debris fences and orange painted squares on the

protective clothing (Helmet, Gloves, etc) on until they have returned to their garage.
18) Places to remove cars from the track
Indicated by 2m long fluorescent orange panels on the barriers.

Through the gate in the pit wall adjacent to grid position 1.
20) Race Suspension

lights.
21) Car number light panels for the start
On the left-hand side of the grid.
22) Post-race parc fermé
Drivers should not complete a full slowing down lap but should enter the pit lane using the pit exit
and proceed slowly down the pit lane in the “wrong” direction. All cars will then be stopped in the
weighing area.
23) Guest access to the grid
For the start of the race and after the end of the race, teams are responsible to ensure that guests
do not cross the teams’ garages and access the pit lane before all cars are on the grid or have
