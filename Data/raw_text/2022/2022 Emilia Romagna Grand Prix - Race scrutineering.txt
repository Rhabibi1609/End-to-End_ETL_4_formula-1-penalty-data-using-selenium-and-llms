The instantaneous fuel mass flow all cars was checked.
The fuel temperature all cars was checked.
A fuel sample was taken from car number 63.
The fuel samples have been checked for density and analysed by gas chromatography.
The results of all the fuel analyses show that the fuels were the same as ones, which had been
approved for use by the relevant competitors prior to the Event.
Further the density change of the fuel samples taken today was within the permitted limits.
An engine oil sample was taken from car number 63.
The engine oil samples have been analysed by FTIR spectroscopy and viscometry.
