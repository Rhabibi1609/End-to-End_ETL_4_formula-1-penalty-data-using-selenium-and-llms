From The Stewards Document 56
To The Team Manager, Date 22 May 2022
Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 16:01
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 10 - Pierre Gasly
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 15:43
Session Race
Fact Collision with Car 18 at turn 1.
Offence Breach of Article 2 d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty
2 penalty points (total of 4 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence. Stroll was fully alongside on the outside
of Gasly from turn-in to the apex, and gave Gasly sufficient room. Gasly
understeered into Stroll and the Stewards found him wholly at fault for the collision,
although the collision was more due to a lack of grip.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
