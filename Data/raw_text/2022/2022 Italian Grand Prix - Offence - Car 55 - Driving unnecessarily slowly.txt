Scuderia Ferrari
Time 15:50
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (Document 37) and
heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 13:18
Session Practice 3
Fact Driving unnecessarily slowly at T1.
Offence Breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver (driving)
This is the driverâ€™s 4th reprimand for the season
Warning for the Team
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 55 (Carlos Sainz) and team
representative and examined video and telemetry evidence.
The driver argued that he had to drive below 60km/h on his in lap in order to cool
down his tyres. The Stewards checked the telemetry of a number of other cars
including that of his teammate (Car 16) and noted that the other cars were at least 20
km/h faster at Turn 1 than Car 55 (which at one point during this incident, was
recorded at 50 km/h).
The Stewards also considered, in possible mitigation, that the driver of Car 55
checked his mirrors no less than 6 times between the control line and the entry to
Turn 1, however the fact remains that he drove unnecessarily slowly and as a result,
a potentially dangerous situation was created.
Further, the Team is formally warned that it needs to be more alert in informing its
drivers of approaching cars and that it is wrong to assume that cars will always do a
cool down lap after a push lap. In this case the driver received no information at all
from the Team about the rapid approach of Car 77.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
