2022 CANADIAN GRAND PRIX
16 - 19 June 2022
From The Stewards Document 74
To The Team Manager, Date 19 June 2022
BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 17:27
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 70 & 71)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 14 - Fernando Alonso
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 15:39
Session Race
Fact More than one change of direction to defend a position.
Offence Breach of Article 2 b) of Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting
Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
1 penalty point (total of 6 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of car 14 (Fernando Alonso), the driver of car 77
(Valtteri Bottas) and team representatives and examined video evidence and
telemetry from car 77.
Between turns 10 and 12, on the penultimate lap of the race, car 14 made repeated
changes of direction to defend against car 77 who had to lift at one point and briefly
lost momentum. Whilst noting the driverâ€™s point that at no stage was any point of car
77 alongside car 14, the Stewards consider this to be a clear breach of the above
regulation. The Stewards therefore impose a 5 seconds time penalty in line with that
imposed for a similar incident in Australia 2022.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
