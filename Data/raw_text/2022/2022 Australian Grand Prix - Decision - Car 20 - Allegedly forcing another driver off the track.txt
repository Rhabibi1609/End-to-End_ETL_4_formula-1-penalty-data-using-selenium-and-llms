Time 18:35
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 72 & 73)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 20 - Kevin Magnussen
Competitor Haas F1 Team
Time 16:22
Session Race
Fact Forcing another driver off the track.
Offence Alleged breach of Chapter IV, Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the drivers of Car 14 (Fernando Alonso), Car 20 (Kevin
Magnussen) and team representatives and examined video evidence.
After MAG passed ALO at turn 3, ALO had a run and was attempting an outside pass
on MAG going through turn 4. The cars went through turn 4 essentially side by side
but at the exit ALO was off the track. The drivers agreed that this was hard racing with
no clear breach of the regulations. The Stewards agree and take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
