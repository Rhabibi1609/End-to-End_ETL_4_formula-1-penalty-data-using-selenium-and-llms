Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Oracle Red Bull Racing team and the BWT Alpine F1 Team, who
are associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the twelve
and a half hours period which commenced at 23:00 on 18 November, fifteen and a half hours before
the scheduled start time of P3 and ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 11:30
on 19 November.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the Oracle Red Bull Racing team and
the BWT Alpine F1 Team during the 2022 Formula One Championship season and therefore no
action should be taken.
