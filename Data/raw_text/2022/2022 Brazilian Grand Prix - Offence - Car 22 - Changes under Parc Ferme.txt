Time 12:35
The Stewards, having received a report from the Technical Delegate (document 46), have
considered the following matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 12:16
Session Sprint
Fact The following parts have been replaced and changes to the setup have been made:
Floor (same specification)
Front Wing/Nose assembly (different specification)
Rear Wing (different specification)
Offence Breach of Article 40.9 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Required to start the race from the pit lane.
Reason The changed items were replaced whilst the car was in parc ferme with the approval
of the Technical Delegate.
The front wing/nose assembly and the rear wing are of a different specification to that
which was used previously. Changes have also been made to the setup of the
suspension of car 22. The competitor is therefore required to start the race from the
pit lane per article 40.9 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
