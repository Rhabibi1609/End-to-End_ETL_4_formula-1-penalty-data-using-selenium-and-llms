Time 17:44
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 16 - Charles Leclerc
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 17:05
Session Race
Fact Leaving the track and gaining an advantage.
Offence Breach of App L Ch IV 2 c) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty imposed after the race
(5 seconds added to elapsed race time).
1 penalty point (total of 1 for the 12 month period)
Reason The Stewards reviewed video evidence.
Although car 16 did not gain a position by going off track, it was still deemed to have
gained a lasting advantage. This determination takes into account the numerous
driver briefings where the Race Directors advised that an “advantage” would be
considered as having been gained if you go off track and return in the same position
whilst defending. There have been a number of precedents this year in particular
ZHO in Saudi Arabia and ALO in Miami.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
