NOTE TO TEAMS: AUTOMOBILE DISPLAY PROCEDURES
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the Sporting regulations, please note the
following procedures for the Pre-Event Automobile Display at this event:
 Between 13:30 and 14:30 on Friday, one car from each team must be positioned
between the team’s pit stop area and the edge of the fast lane. Please note that the fast
lane will be used for a Paddock Club pit lane walk and therefore the teams must have
their own tensor barriers in place to separate this from the Pre-Event Automobile Display.
The other car may be used for pit stop practice.
 There must be enough space around the car on display to allow people to move safely.
 The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid
overlapping of any presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to hold (any
presentations are not mandatory on Friday):
Time Team
13:30 - 13:36 Mercedes
13:36 - 13:42 RBR
13:42 - 13:48 Ferrari
13:48 - 13:54 McLaren
13:54 - 14:00 Alpine
14:00 - 14:06 Alpha Tauri
14:06 - 14:12 Aston Martin
14:12 - 14:18 Williams
14:18 - 14:24 Alpha Romeo
14:24 - 14:30 Haas
 Teams may conduct additional interviews and discussions outside of these times should
they wish, but it is highly recommended that these times are used by all teams to
maximise efficiency.
 After qualifying on Saturday, three cars for the presentation will be selected for display at
this event – one car eliminated in Q1, one eliminated in Q2 and one in Q3. This selection
will be communicated to the teams by the FIA Technical Delegate at the end of each
section of Qualifying.
 Due to activity in the pit lane that directly follows F1 qualifying, the Saturday
presentations will take place inside the team garages, and because of this constraint
we will allow only the F1 TV camera and 5 members of the written media to attend, with
timings as follows:
o 19:30 – Car eliminated in Q1
o 19:40 – Car eliminated in Q2
o 19:50 – Car eliminated in Q3
 Each team that is selected must have the technical representative indicated previously to
the FIA available in the garage at these times.
