Session Qualifying
Fact The rear wing assembly, front wing ballast and the setup of the suspension have been
changed.
Offence Breach of Article 40.9 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Required to start the race from the pit lane.
Reason The changed rear wing assembly is of a different specification from the one used
during Qualification. The part was replaced with the approval of the FIA Technical
Delegate as per article 40.3.
As the rear wing assembly is a different specification and was changed whilst the car
was in parc ferme and the suspension setup has also changed, the competitor is
required to start the race from the pit lane per article 40.9 b) of the FIA Formula One
Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
