2022 AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX
7 - 10 April 2022
From The Stewards Document 19
To The Team Manager, Date 08 April 2022
Scuderia Ferrari
Time 16:04
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 14 & 15)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 13:12
Session Practice 1
Fact Impeding of Car 24 by Car 55 at turn 14
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driver’s 1st Reprimand of the Season (Driving)
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 55 (Carlos Sainz), the driver of Car 24
(Zhou Guanyu) and team representatives and examined video evidence. Car 55 was
on his first lap of the session, having been delayed starting the session. Car 24 was
on a push lap. SAI admitted that because of his issues getting onto the track that he
was distracted and still getting adapted to the track. Additionally, there was a problem
with his radio volume, which was also noted by the Stewards in their review, that
prevented him from hearing calls from his team about ZHO’s approach. SAI took
evasive action as soon as he saw ZHO, but it was too late to avoid impeding him as
SAI himself acknowledged.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
