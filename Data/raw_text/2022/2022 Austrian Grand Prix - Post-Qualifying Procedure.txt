NOTE TO TEAMS: POST QUALIFYING PROCEDURE
The Post-Qualifying interview procedure requires the top three (3) drivers to be interviewed on the track
once they have got out of their cars.
Should either of your drivers be among the top three (3) at the end of qualifying we would like to ask for
your co-operation in following the procedure below:
• If they take the chequered flag at the end of Q3, the fastest three (3) drivers should stay on the track
and return to the Grid where the 1, 2, 3 boards which will be located in the vicinity of Grid Position 11.
• Other than the team mechanics (with cooling fans if necessary), officials and FIA pre-approved
television crews and the four (4) FIA approved photographers, no one else will be allowed in this
designated area at this time (no driver physios nor team PR personnel). At the sole discretion of the
FIA Media Delegate, the team-embedded photographer of the pole position driver may also be
permitted in the Parc Fermé area at this time.
(cid:120) Once out of their cars, the top three (3) Drivers will be weighed by the FIA. Each Driver must remain
fully attired until after they have been weighed (e.g: Helmet, Gloves, etc).
• After the Drivers have been weighed, the Post-Qualifying interviews will take place in this designated
area. The interviewer will be selected by the Commercial Rights Holder.
• If one (1) of the top three (3) drivers is already in the Pit Lane at the end of the session, the team should
ensure that he goes directly to the designated area once the other drivers have arrived there.
• At the end of the live interviews the drivers will be led to the backdrop at the Pit Entry for the Top 3 and
Pirelli Award photo opportunities.
• Drivers eliminated in Q1 and Q2, drivers classified from 4th to 10th in Q3 and drivers who did not
participate to Q1 but are eligible to race must attend the TV interview session in the paddock behind
the FIA garages after they have been weighed by the FIA at the end of the last part of qualifying in
which they participated.
• The top three drivers must also attend the TV interview session after they have completed their parc
fermé interviews.
