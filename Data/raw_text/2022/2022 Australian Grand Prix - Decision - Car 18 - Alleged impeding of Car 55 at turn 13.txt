and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 16:05
Session Practice 2
Fact Impeding of Car 55 by Car 18 at turn 13.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 55
(Carlos Sainz) and team representatives and examined video evidence.
Due to the presence of multiple cars converging on the final corners, all of which
impacted the situation, the Stewards consider that Car 18 did not unnecessarily
impede Car 55 and take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
