To The Team Manager, Date 23 April 2022
Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 20:55
The Stewards, having received a report from the Technical Delegate (document 37), summoned
(document 38) and heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 20:06
Session Sprint
Fact Working on the car and carrying out unsupervised work on car 24 under Parc Ferme
Conditions.
Offence Breach of Article 40.6 and 40.9 of FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The car is required to start the race from the pit lane.
Reason Car 24 was involved in a collision and suffered significant damage during the Sprint
session
In repairing Car 24 subsequent to the Sprint session, Car 24 was found to have
breached Article 40.6 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations as the car used
during the Sprint session was not covered and ready for FIA seals within 2 hours of
the Sprint session. Furthermore, in breach of Article 40.9, the Competitor was found
to have continued to work on the car unsupervised while under parc ferme conditions.
The Competitor admitted that modifications were made to the car.
In any event, given the lack of supervision the Stewards would have been entitled to
draw an inference that modifications were made to the car and/or changes were
made to the set-up of the suspension while the car was to have been held under parc
ferme conditions.
The penalty for breach of the parc ferme conditions is specified in Article 40.9 b),
which is for the driver to start from the pit lane. We accordingly imposed the penalty
stipulated in Article 40.9 b).
