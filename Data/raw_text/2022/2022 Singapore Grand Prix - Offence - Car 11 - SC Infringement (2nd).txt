Time 01:42
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (Document 53) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 22:33
Session Race
Fact Falling more than 10 car lengths of the Safety Car.
Offence Breach of 55.10 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty imposed after the race
(5 seconds added to elapsed race time).
2 penalty points (total of 2 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 11 (Sergio Perez), the team
representative and have reviewed video evidence.
Article 55.10 of the FIA Formula 1 Sporting Regulations requires that the leader must
keep within 10 car lengths of the safety car once deployed until the lights are
extinguished.
Car 11 was the lead car on lap 36 during the second safety car period in the race. It
was admitted that while the lights of the safety car were still on, PER failed to keep
within 10 car lengths of the safety car between turn 13 and turn 14.
This occurred notwithstanding the fact that the Race Director had issued a warning to
the team that PER was not respecting the less than 10 car lengths regulation between
turns 9 and 10. The team passed that warning on to PER.
We refer to Doc 56 by which we imposed a reprimand on PER for a breach of the
same regulation during the first safety car deployment during the race.
As this was the second breach of Article 55.10 by PER during the race and followed
an express warning from the Race Director, we determined to impose a 5 second
time penalty on PER.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
