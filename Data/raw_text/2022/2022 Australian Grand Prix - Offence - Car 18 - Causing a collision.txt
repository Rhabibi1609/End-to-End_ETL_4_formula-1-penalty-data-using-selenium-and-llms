Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 18:53
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 43 & 44)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 16:15
Session Qualifying
Fact Collision between Car 6 and Car 18.
Offence Alleged breach of Appendix L Chapter IV 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions
2 penalty points (total of 7 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 6
(Nicholas Latifi) and team representatives and examined video evidence.
LAT pulled off course to the left and slowed at the exit of turn 4 to let cars by, the last
of which was STR. At the exit of turn 5, STR appeared to not accelerate and was in
the middle of the track. LAT made the decision to accelerate and pass STR on the
right as STR was moving right toward the right hand edge of the track where the track
curves slightly to the right on the run to turn 6. Contact was made between STR’s right
front wheel and LAT’s left rear wheel, with the subsequent damage putting both cars
out of the session. The Stewards find that STR was predominantly to blame for the
collision because of his lack of situational awareness of LAT’s passing manoeuvre.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
