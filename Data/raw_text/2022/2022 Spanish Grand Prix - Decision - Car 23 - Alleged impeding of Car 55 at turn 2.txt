Williams Racing
Time 20:56
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 22 & 23)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 17:06
Session Practice 2
Fact Alleged impeding of Car 55 by Car 23 at turn 2.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 23 (Alexander Albon), the driver of Car 55
(Carlos Sainz) and team representatives and examined video evidence and
determined that Car 23 attempted to slow down and take avoiding action when
informed of Car 55 arriving on a fast lap.
Notwithstanding that, Car 23 ended up causing Car 55 to abort his fast lap. Both
drivers agreed that he had taken reasonable action and the Stewards therefore find
that the impeding was not “unnecessary”.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
