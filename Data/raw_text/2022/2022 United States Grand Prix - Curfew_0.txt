Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team and the Scuderia
AlphaTauri team, who are associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the
circuit during the eleven and a half hour period which commenced at 23:30 on 21 October, fourteen
and a half hours before the scheduled start time of P3 and ended three hours before the scheduled
start time of P3 at 11:00 on 22 October.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the Mercedes-AMG Petronas
Formula One Team and the Scuderia AlphaTauri team during the 2022 Formula One Championship
season and therefore no action should be taken.
