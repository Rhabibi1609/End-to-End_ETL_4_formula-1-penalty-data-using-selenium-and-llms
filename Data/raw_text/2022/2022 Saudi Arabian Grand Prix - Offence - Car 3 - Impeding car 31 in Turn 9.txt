From The Stewards Document 40
To The Team Manager, Date 27 March 2022
McLaren F1 Team
Time 00:18
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 35 & 36)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 3 - Daniel Ricciardo
Competitor McLaren F1 Team
Time 20:36
Session Qualifying
Fact Impeding of Car 31 by Car 3 in turn 9
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions to Car 3 and a fine of â‚¬10,000 to the team.
1 Penalty point (1 point in a 12 month period)
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 3 (Daniel Ricciardo), the driver of Car 31
(Esteban Ocon) and team representatives, and examined video, team radio evidence
and found that Car 3 impeded Car 31.
The driver admitted that he did not know that Car 31 was coming on a fast lap as he
was not told of that by his team. By the time he saw Car 31 approaching, it was too
late. The team representative admitted that they had made an error in not warning
their driver about Car 31 approaching.
The driver of Car 31 stated that his lap had to be aborted as a result of him being
unnecessarily impeded by Car 3. Having said that, he stated that his overall
performance during the session was not adversely impacted by the aborted lap.
It was clear that Car 31 was unnecessarily impeded by Car 3. The fact that Car 31
was ultimately able to record a faster lap is irrelevant to the fact that the infringement
occurred, such that a timed lap had to be aborted.
It was also clear that the team failed in its duty to keep the driver of Car 3 properly
informed of approaching cars. This is particularly so given the tight nature of this
circuit.
In the circumstances, we impose a penalty of a drop of 3 grip positions to the driver
of Car 3 and a fine of Euro 10,000 to the team.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
