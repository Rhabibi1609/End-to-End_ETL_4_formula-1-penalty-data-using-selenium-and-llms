Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the McLaren F1 Team, who are associated with the operation of the
car, were within the confines of the circuit during the eleven hour period which commenced at 23:00
on 27 May, fourteen hours before the scheduled start time of P3 and ends three hours before the
scheduled start time of P3 at 10:00 on 28 May.
This was the second of the two individual exceptions permitted for the McLaren F1 Team during the
2022 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
