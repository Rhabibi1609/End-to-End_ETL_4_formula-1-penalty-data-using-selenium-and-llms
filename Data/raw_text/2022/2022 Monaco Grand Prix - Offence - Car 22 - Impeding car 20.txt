2022 MONACO GRAND PRIX
26 - 29 May 2022
From The Stewards Document 22
To The Team Manager, Date 27 May 2022
Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 19:01
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 18 & 19)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 17:38
Session Practice 2
Fact Unnecessary impeding of Car 20 by Car 22 at turn 10.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driverâ€™s 4th Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda), the driver of Car 20
(Kevin Magnussen) and team representatives and examined video and radio
evidence.
It was clear that the driver of Car 22 was given ample and multiple warnings of the
approach of Car 20, yet still chose to stay on the racing line approaching Turn 10,
forcing Car 20 to take evading action by having to drive through the chicane.
Although it is not common to impose penalties for impeding during free practice
sessions, this incident was sufficiently serious to warrant the penalty imposed.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
