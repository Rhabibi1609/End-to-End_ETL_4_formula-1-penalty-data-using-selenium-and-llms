Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last Wednesday team personnel of the Scuderia AlphaTauri team, who are associated with the
operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the thirteen hour period which
commenced at 20:30 on 04 May, fourtytwo hours before the scheduled start time of P1 and ends
twentynine hours before the scheduled start time of P1 at 09:30 on 05 May.
This was the first of the eight individual exceptions permitted for the Scuderia AlphaTauri team during
the 2022 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
