Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last Wednesday team personnel of the Oracle Red Bull Racing team, who are associated with the
operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the thirteen hour period which
commenced at 23:00 on 23 March, fourtytwo hours before the scheduled start time of P1 and ends
twentynine hours before the scheduled start time of P1 at 12:00 on 24 March.
This was the first of the eight individual exceptions permitted for the Oracle Red Bull Racing team
during the 2022 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
