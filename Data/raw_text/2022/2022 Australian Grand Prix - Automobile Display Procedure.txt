NOTE TO TEAMS: CAR DISPLAY PROCEDURES
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the Sporting regulations, please note the following
procedures for the Car Display at this event:
(cid:120) Between 11:30 and 12:30 on Friday, one car from each team must be positioned as shown in the
attached drawing, with the other car positioned and available for viewing inside your garage.
(cid:120) The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking place the
car must return to the same position.
(cid:120) At any event where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the cars in
position and use your grid easy ups.
(cid:120) There must be enough space around the car on display to allow people to move safely.
(cid:120) The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid overlapping of
any presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to hold (any presentations are not
mandatory on Friday):
Time Team
11:30 - 11:36 Mercedes
11:36 - 11:42 RBR

(cid:120) Teams may conduct additional interviews and discussions outside of these times should they
wish, but it is highly recommended that these times are used by all teams to maximise efficiency.
(cid:120) After qualifying on Saturday, three cars for the presentation will be selected for display at this
event – one car eliminated in Q1, one eliminated in Q2 and one in Q3. This selection will be
communicated to the teams by the FIA Technical Delegate at the end of each section of
Qualifying.

change according to the time at which Qualifying ends):
o 17:30 – Car eliminated in Q1
o 17:45 – Car eliminated in Q2

available at these times.
