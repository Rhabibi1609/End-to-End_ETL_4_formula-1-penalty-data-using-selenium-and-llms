Time 19:29
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 16:01
Session Race
Fact Driving on track in unsafe condition.
Offence Article 12.5.6. of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Non driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda) and team
representative and examined video and audio evidence.
While after a pit stop of car 22 the driver stopped the car due to the fact that he felt a
wheel being not properly fitted, the investigation by the Stewards led to the conclusion,
that in fact there was a problem with the differential. Therefor the car was not in an
unsafe condition when released from its pit stop position.
However, during the hearing the driver admitted, that after stopping on track he was
ready to abandon the car and started to loosen the safety belt, without unlocking it.
After that he travelled back to the pits where the mechanics re-fastened the belts. It is
not possible, to determine exactly to which degree the seatbelt had been loosened by
the driver.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
