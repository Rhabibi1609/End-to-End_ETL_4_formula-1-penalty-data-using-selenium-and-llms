Time 19:08
The Stewards, having received a report from the Technical Delegate (document 26), summoned
(document 27) and heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 17:33
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 23 used a tyre set in Q1 which had been electronically returned.
Offence Breach of Article 30.4 b) read with 30.5 i) v) of the FIA Formula One Sporting
Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Williams F1 Team) is fined €1,000.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative of Car 23 (Alexander Albon) and
the Technical Delegate and determined that due to an administrative lapse, the team
had incorrectly indicated the reference number of the set of tyres that they were
returning to the tyre manufacturer, within the time specified in the regulations.
The Technical Delegate confirmed that this was likely to have been an administrative
error on the part of the team as a set of unused physical tyres were returned within
time, per the regulations.
As this was nevertheless a technical breach of the regulations, we imposed a fine of
€1,000 on the team.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
