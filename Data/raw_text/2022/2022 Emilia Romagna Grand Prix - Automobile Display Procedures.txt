NOTE TO TEAMS: CAR DISPLAY PROCEDURES
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the Sporting regulations, please note the
following procedures for the Car Display at this event:
(cid:120) Between 12:00 and 13:00 on Friday, one car from each team must be positioned as
shown in the attached drawing, with the other car positioned and available for viewing
inside your garage.
(cid:120) The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking
place the car must return to the same position.
(cid:120) At any event where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the
cars in position and use your grid easy-ups.
(cid:120) There must be enough space around the car on display to allow people to move safely.
(cid:120) The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid
overlapping of any presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to hold (any

maximise efficiency.

this event – one car eliminated in Q1, one eliminated in Q2 and one in Q3. This selection
will be communicated to the teams by the FIA Technical Delegate at the end of each
section of Qualifying.
(cid:120) The Post-Qualifying presentations will take place in the pit lane or team garages
