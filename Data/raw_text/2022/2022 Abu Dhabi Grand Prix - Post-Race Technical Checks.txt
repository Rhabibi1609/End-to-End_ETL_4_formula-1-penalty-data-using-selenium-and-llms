TECHNICAL DELEGATEâ€™S REPORT
After the race of the Abu Dhabi GP the McLaren F1 Team was randomly chosen among the ten
teams for more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections was the pit stop system (wheel guns, front and rear jacks,
pneumatic system, traffic light, control hardware and software, sensors and looms).
All inspected components were found to be in compliance with the 2022 Formula One Technical
Regulations and TD022 C.
