Fact Unsafe release of car 31.
Offence Breach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that Car 31 was released
in an unsafe manner from a pit stop. Car 44 had to take evasive action to prevent a
collision. We accordingly imposed a 5-second time penalty. No penalty points were
warranted as the infringement was caused by the unsafe release by the team.

Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
