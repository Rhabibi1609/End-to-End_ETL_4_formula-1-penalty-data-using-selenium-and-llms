Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 17:56
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 43 and 44)
and heard from the drivers and team representative, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 14:44
Session Race
Fact Car 18 moved in a manner which caused a collision with Car 14 between T11 and
T12.
Offence Breach of Appendix L Ch IV 2 e) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 3 Grid Positions.
2 penalty points (total of 5 for the 12-month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 14
(Fernando Alonso), and team representatives and have reviewed video evidence.
It was clear to us that the driver of Car 18 made a late move in reacting to the
overtaking attempt by the driver of Car 14 by moving to the left. The stewards
determine that the driver of Car 18 was predominantly to blame.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
