Clarification
In the event of a rolling start, under Article 52.1 last paragraph, the Start is defined as when the
leading car crosses “the Line”. The sporting regulations in numerous places (e.g. Article 5.4), refers
to the Control Line as the Line. The Control Line also crosses the Pit Lane.
For the purposes of Article 30.5 n) of the sporting regulations, the Start will therefore occur when the
leading car crosses the Control Line.
In reference to Article 51.1, the Stewards have advised they will consider the word “should” NOT to
mean “must”.
