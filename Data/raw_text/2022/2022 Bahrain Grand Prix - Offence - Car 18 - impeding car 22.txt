From The Stewards Document 16
To The Team Manager, Date 18 March 2022
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 20:24
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 11 & 12)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 19:01
Session Practice 2
Fact Impeding of Car 22 by Car 18 in Turn 8.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver
This is the driverâ€™s 1st Reprimand of the Season (Driving)
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 22
(Yuki Tsunoda) and team representatives, and examined video and team radio
evidence.
After both cars had taken the chequered flag at the end of the session, car 18 (STR)
turned into turn 8 whilst car 22 (TSU) was approaching quickly to the inside,
unnecessarily impeding car 22 and causing minor contact. Driver 18 says he was
travelling slowly in preparation for a practice start and was looking in his mirrors but
the closing speed from cars behind travelling much more quickly meant he did not see
car 22 when approaching turn 8. The Stewards acknowledge this, and note that the
Team did not give the driver any radio warning of approaching cars, but consider that
the driver has responsibility for maintaining awareness of cars around them and that
this applies equally on the lap after the chequered flag. The Stewards therefore
determine that this is a breach of the above regulation and impose a Reprimand in
this case.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
