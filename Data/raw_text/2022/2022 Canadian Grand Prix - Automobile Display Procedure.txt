(cid:120) The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking place the
car must return to the same position.
(cid:120) At any event where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the cars in
position and use your grid easy ups.
(cid:120) There must be enough space around the car on display to allow people to move safely.
(cid:120) The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid overlapping of
