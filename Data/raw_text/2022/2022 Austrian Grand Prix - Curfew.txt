Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Williams Racing team, who are associated with the operation of the
car, were within the confines of the circuit during the fourteen hour period which commenced at
19:30 on 07 July, eighteen hours before the scheduled start time of P1 and ends four hours before
the scheduled start time of P1 at 09:30 on 08 July.
This was the second of the six individual exceptions permitted for the Williams Racing team during
the 2022 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
