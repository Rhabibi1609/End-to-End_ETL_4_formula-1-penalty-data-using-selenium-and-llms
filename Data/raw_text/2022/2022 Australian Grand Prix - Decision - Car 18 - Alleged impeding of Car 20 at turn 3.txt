From The Stewards Document 20
To The Team Manager, Date 08 April 2022
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 16:04
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 16 & 17)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 13:32
Session Practice 1
Fact Impeding of Car 20 by Car 18 at turn 3.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 20
(Kevin Magnussen) and team representatives and examined video and team radio
evidence.
MAG was on a second consecutive push lap. STR was on a cool down lap. STR was
told by his team that MAG was in phase with him and not on a push lap, because they
had not recognized his double push lap program at that early point on the lap. STR did
not attempt to stay out of MAG’s way, as he could not determine that he was actually
on a push lap from the short period of time he was visible in his mirrors. He,
therefore, relied on his team’s radio calls. The stewards recognize the difficulty the
teams have in recognizing “non-standard” programs such as this in practice and
choose to take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
