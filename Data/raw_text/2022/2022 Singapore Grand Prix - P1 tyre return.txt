Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
The Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN has not electronically returned two sets of tyres for both of their
cars, car numbers 77 and 24, within two hours after the chequered flag of P1.
As this is not in compliance with Article 30.5) i) iii) of the 2022 Formula One Sporting Regulations, I
am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
