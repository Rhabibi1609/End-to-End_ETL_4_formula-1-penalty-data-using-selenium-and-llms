From The Stewards Document 35
To The Team Manager, Date 17 June 2022
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 21:04
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 23) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter, and determine
the following:
No / Driver 5 - Sebastian Vettel
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 17:44
Session Practice 2
Fact Failure to follow item 14 of the Race Director’s Event Notes.
Offence Breach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driver’s 1st Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of car 5 (Sebastian Vettel) and team
representative and reviewed video evidence. Car 5 left the track at turn 14 and failed
to keep completely to the left of the orange bollard before re-joining the track. The
driver stated that he did not expect the bollard to be there as it was missing during
Practice 1. The Stewards accept that the bollard was not in position during Practice 1,
but consider that the Race Director’s Event Notes were clear in this regard and that a
number of other cars did comply with the instructions during Practice 2. The Stewards
therefore determine that this is a breach of the above regulation by car 5.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
