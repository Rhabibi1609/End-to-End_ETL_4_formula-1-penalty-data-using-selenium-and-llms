The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 45) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 16:46
Session Qualifying
Fact Allegedly failing to respect single yellow flags.
Offence Alleged breach of Appendix H, Art. 2.5.5.b) of the FIA International Sporting Code and
non-compliance with Race Directorâ€™s Event Notes 3.2.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 11 (Sergio Perez), the team
representative and have reviewed video, marshalling system and telemetry evidence.
As PER approached turn 11, a single yellow flag was displayed for a car in the
escape road. PER was warned by his team on the radio at the same time the signals
were displayed at the corner. Compared to his previous lap, he lifted 70 meters
earlier, braked 50 meters earlier, and carried 14kph less speed into the corner. As a
result of these actions, the Stewards conclude that PER acted appropriately to the
situation and take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
