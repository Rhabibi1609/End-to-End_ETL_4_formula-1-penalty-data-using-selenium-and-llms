2022 AZERBAIJAN GRAND PRIX
9 - 12 June 2022
From The Stewards Document 33
To The Team Manager, Date 11 June 2022
McLaren F1 Team
Time 21:25
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 26 & 27)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren F1 Team
Time 18:59
Session Qualifying
Fact Allegedly driving unnecessarily slowly during Qualifying
Offence Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 44 (Lewis Hamilton), the driver of Car 4
(Lando Norris) and the team representatives, and examined video, radio
communication and GPS evidence.
Car 4 was following car 44 when the latter slowed in an effort to get car 4 to pass.
The driver of car 4 decided not to pass and at the same time yellow flags were
displayed at the next marshal post.
Although car 4 was driven slowly, there was no potential danger to any other driver,
this occurred on a straight section of road where visibility was not an issue, and there
was room for the car behind (car 3) to pass if the driver of that car had wanted to. All
three cars (cars 44, 4 and 3) were on “out” laps at the time.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
