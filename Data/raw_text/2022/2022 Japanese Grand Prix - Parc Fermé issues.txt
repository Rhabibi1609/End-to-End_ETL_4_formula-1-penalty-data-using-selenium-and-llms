Technical Delegate’s Report
The following parts have been replaced during the Parc Fermé today by the Scuderia AlphaTauri
team for parts with a different specification:
Car 10: Rear wing
Front wing ballast
The parts have been replaced with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written
request from the team concerned, this being in accordance with Article 40.3 of the 2022 Formula
One Sporting Regulations.
But as the above parts are different from the ones originally used and also changes have been made
to the set up of the rear suspension (with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a
written request), car number 10 should now be required to start from the pit lane according to Article
40.9b of the 2022 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
