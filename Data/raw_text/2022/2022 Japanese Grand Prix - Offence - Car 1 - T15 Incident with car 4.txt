The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 27 & 28) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 15:50
Session Qualifying
Fact Driver of car 1 lost control of the car in T15-T16 as car 4 was attempting to pass.
Offence Breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving)
This is the driver’s first Reprimand of the Season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1 (Max Verstappen), the driver of Car 4
(Lando Norris) and team representatives and reviewed video and timing evidence.
The driver of car 1 was aware of car 55 in front and car 4 approaching from behind
and decided to accelerate at precisely the same time as car 4 decided to overtake
car 1. Unfortunately, due to lack of tyre temperature on car 1, the driver temporarily
lost control of the car causing it to ‘snap’ anti-clockwise.
The driver of car 4 stated that this was simply an unfortunate incident however it is
the driver’s responsibility to at all times maintain control of their car.
Regarding penalty, all previous breaches of this nature have resulted in a Reprimand
hence a similar penalty is imposed in this case.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
