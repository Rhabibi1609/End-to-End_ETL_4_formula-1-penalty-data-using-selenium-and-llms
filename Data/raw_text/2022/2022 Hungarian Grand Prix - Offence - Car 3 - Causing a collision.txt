Time 17:40
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 3 - Daniel Ricciardo
Competitor McLaren F1 Team
Time 16:10
Session Race
Fact Collision with car 18 at turn 2.
Offence Breach of Article 2 d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty
2 penalty points (total of 4 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that RIC was wholly to
blame for the collision. STR was overtaking RIC on the outside of turn 2. RIC, who
was on new hard tyres, locked a front left tyre on the entry to turn 2 causing his car to
understeer and collide into STR, as a result of which STR spun.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
