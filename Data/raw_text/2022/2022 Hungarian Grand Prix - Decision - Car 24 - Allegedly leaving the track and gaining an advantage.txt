2022 HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX
28 - 31 July 2022
From The Stewards Document 43
To The Team Manager, Date 31 July 2022
Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 17:51
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 16:43
Session Race
Fact Allegedly left the track and gained an advantage in turn 14.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 2 c) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that while ZHO left the
track, he did not gain a lasting advantage from doing so. On the last lap of the race
ZHO, who was on better tyres, had been following MSC while attempting to overtake.
At turn 13 ZHO attempted an overtake of MSC on the outside. While a significant
portion of this car was alongside MSC, he was slightly behind at the apex. MSC
opened his steering leaving no room for ZHO on the outside as a result of which ZHO
left the track to avoid a collision. Having left the track, he then fell in behind MSC at
the entry to turn 14. MSC took a line through turn 14 on the dirty side of the track
which left ZHO room to overtake MSC on the inside and ZHO legitimately took that
opportunity.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
