Fact The following Power Unit Elements have been used:
6th Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)
4th Energy Store (ES)
4th Control Electronics (CE)
Offence Breach of Article 40.9 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Required to start the race from the pit lane.
Reason The changed PU elements were replaced whilst the car was in parc ferme without the
approval of the Technical Delegate.
As the PU elements were changed without approval of the Technical Delegate this is
not in accordance with Article 40.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. The
competitor is therefore required to start the race from the pit lane per article 40.9 b)
of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
