McLaren F1 Team
Time 17:12
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 20 & 21)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 3 - Daniel Ricciardo
Competitor McLaren F1 Team
Time 14:38
Session Practice 1
Fact Car 47 had to take avoiding action to avoid Car 3 between Turns 16 and 17.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 47 (Mick Schumacher), the driver of Car
3 (Daniel Ricciardo), team representatives and examined video and telemetry
evidence.
The driver of Car 3 was warned that a Red Bull car was on a fast lap whilst he and
Car 18 were on slow laps. Car 18 was on the fast line, Car 3 to its left. The driver of
Car 3 realised he needed to slow to allow Car 18 to pull ahead however this occurred
at the same time as Car 47 (also on a slow lap) approached. Both drivers expressed
the view that although it is disadvantageous to run off the racing line (due to the
newness of the track surface and loose pebbles), it would be important in other
sessions to ensure that slower cars stayed off the racing line.
The Stewards noted that there was very little brake applied by the driver of Car 3 and
decided that this could not be deemed as “erratic” driving.
The Stewards reinforce the view that drivers not on a fast lap should endeavour to
stay off the racing line when in the vicinity of other cars.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
