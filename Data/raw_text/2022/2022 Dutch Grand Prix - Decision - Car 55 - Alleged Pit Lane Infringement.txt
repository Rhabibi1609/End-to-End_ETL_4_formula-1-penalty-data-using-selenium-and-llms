Time 19:13
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 15:21
Session Race
Fact Car 55 was approaching the pit position in an unsafe manner.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 34.14 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 55 (Carlos Sainz) and team
representatives of Car 55 and Car 11 (Sergio Perez) and examined video evidence.
The Stewards determined that the driver travelled very closely to the pit team of Red
Bull Racing whilst approaching Scuderia Ferrari’s pit position. Car 55 rear right wheel
even touched one of Red Bull Racing wheel gun’s air hoses.
The Stewards further determined that the slight touch of the Red Bull Racing wheel
gun’s air hose was rather due to the configuration of Zandvoort pit lane which is
particularly short. Therefore, no further action is taken.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
