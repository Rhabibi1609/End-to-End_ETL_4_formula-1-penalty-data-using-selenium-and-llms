Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race of the Canadian GP car numbers 44, 11 and 55 were randomly chosen among the top
ten cars for more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the plank assembly, the front floor structure and the
device between the front floor structure and survival cell. Furthermore the device between the front
floor structure and survival cell was submitted to static and dynamic load tests.
All inspected components were found to be in compliance with the 2022 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
