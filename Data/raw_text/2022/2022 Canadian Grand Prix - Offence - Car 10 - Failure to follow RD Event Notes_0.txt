Time 20:23
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 46) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter, and determine
the following:
No / Driver 10 - Pierre Gasly
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 16:15
Session Qualifying
Fact Failure to follow item 14 of the Race Director’s Event Notes.
Offence Breach of Article 12.2.1.i) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driver’s 2nd Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 10 (Pierre Gasly) and team
representative and reviewed video evidence.
Car 10 left the track at turn 9 and failed to keep completely to the left of the orange
bollard before re-joining the track. The driver explained that he had issues with his
brakes but accepts that he did not comply with the Race Director’s instructions in this
instance. The Stewards therefore determine that this is a breach of the above
regulation by car 10.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
