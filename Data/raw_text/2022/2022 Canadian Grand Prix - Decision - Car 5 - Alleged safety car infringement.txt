From The Stewards Document 73
To The Team Manager, Date 19 June 2022
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 17:23
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 68) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 5 - Sebastian Vettel
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 15:10
Session Race
Fact Failure to keep within 10 car lengths of the car in front under Safety Car conditions.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 55.7 of the Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of car 5 (Sebastian Vettel) and the team
representative, and examined GPS evidence.
After initially closing up to the car in front under the Safety Car procedure, for a
period of time car 5 did not maintain the 10-car length rule. However, towards the end
of the Safety Car period re-closed the gap and then maintained the required position
until the race resumption. The Stewards also note that there were other drivers who
also failed to keep to the 10-car lengths at different times during the procedure but
that all were compliant at the end of the Safety Car period. Therefore the Stewards
conclude that a penalty for car 5 is not appropriate in these circumstances.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits
