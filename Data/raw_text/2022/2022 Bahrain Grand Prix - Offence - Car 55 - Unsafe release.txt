Scuderia Ferrari
Time 17:06
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 25) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 15:54
Session Practice 3
Fact Unsafe release of car 55
Offence Breach of Article 34.14 (a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand to the driver. (Non-driving)
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 55 (Carlos Sainz) and team
representative, and examined video evidence.
Car 55 was released from its garage into the path of car 14, causing car 14 to stop in
the fast lane. The driver accepts that he was at fault in this incident due to a
misunderstanding of the communication signals from the mechanic, compounded by
his lack of vision to the side of the car. The Stewards determine this to be a breach of
the above the regulation and impose a Reprimand. In the circumstances they do not
consider this to be ‘imposed for a driving infringement’ for the purposes of Article
18.2 of the Sporting Regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
