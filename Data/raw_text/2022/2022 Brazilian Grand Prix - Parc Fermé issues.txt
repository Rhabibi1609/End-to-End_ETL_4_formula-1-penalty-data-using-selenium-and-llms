Technical Delegate’s Report
The following parts have been replaced during the Parc Fermé yesterday and today by Scuderia
AlphaTauri team:
Car 22: Floor (same specification)
Front wing/nose assembly (different specification)
Rear wing (different specification)
The parts have been replaced with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written
request from the team concerned, this being in accordance with Article 40.3 of the 2022 Formula
One Sporting Regulations.
But as some of the above parts are different from the ones originally used and also changes have
been made to the set up of the suspension (with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following
a written request), car number 22 should now be required to start from the pit lane according to
Article 40.9b of the 2022 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
