From The Stewards Document 21
To The Team Manager, Date 20 May 2022
Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 16:48
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 17 & 18)
and heard from the driver of car 36 and team representative, have considered the following matter
and determine the following:
No / Driver 36 - Juri Vips
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 14:52
Session Practice 1
Fact Impeding of Car 63 by Car 36 at turn 12.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driver’s 1st Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 36 (Juri Vips) and team representatives
and examined video evidence.
The team manager indicated that the team had provided the driver the wrong
information having had a software issue. Thus the driver was following the team’s
advice, but was certainly driving slowly on the racing line and forced car 63 to take
evasive action thereby unnecessarily impeding.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
