The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 6 - Nicholas Latifi
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 16:06
Session Race
Fact Alleged incident between cars 6 and 20 at T2.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 2 d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting
Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that no driver was wholly
or predominantly to blame for the collision. LAT overtook MAG on the inside of turn 1
and was slightly ahead of MAG at the apex of turn 2 on the outside. Contact occurred
between MAG and LAT just after the apex of turn 2. Both cars sustained damage and
retired from the race. The Stewards considered that both drivers contributed to the
collision. LAT could have left more room for MAG on the inside of turn 2 but MAG
must have known that LAT was on the outside and could have taken a tighter line
through turn 2 or yielded to LAT.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
