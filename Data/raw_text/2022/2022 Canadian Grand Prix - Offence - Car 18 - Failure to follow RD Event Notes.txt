16 - 19 June 2022
From The Stewards Document 36
To The Team Manager, Date 17 June 2022
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 21:05
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 24) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter, and determine
the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 18:00
Session Practice 2
Fact Failure to follow item 14 of the Race Director’s Event Notes.
Offence Breach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driver’s 2nd Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of car 18 (Lance Stroll) and team representative
and reviewed video evidence. Car 18 left the track at turn 14 and failed to keep
completely to the left of the orange bollard before re-joining the track. The driver
stated that he did not see the bollard until too late. The Stewards note that the bollard
was not in position during Practice 1, but consider that the Race Director’s Event
Notes were clear in this regard and that a number of other cars did comply with the
instructions during Practice 2. The Stewards therefore determine that this is a breach
of the above regulation by car 18.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
