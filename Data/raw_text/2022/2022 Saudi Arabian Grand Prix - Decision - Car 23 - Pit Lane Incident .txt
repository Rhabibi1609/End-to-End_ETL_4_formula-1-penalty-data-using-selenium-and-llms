Time 00:17
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 32, 33 &
34) and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 20:17
Session Qualifying
Fact Unsafe release of car 23.
Offence Alleged Breach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 20 (Kevin Magnussen), the driver of Car
23 (Alexander Albon), the driver of Car 3 (Daniel Ricciardo) and team
representatives, and examined video, team radio evidence and found that the release
from the garage did require Car 3 to slow down while in the fast lane.
However, all three drivers and their team representatives were unanimous in their
view that the situation was benign and did not create an unsafe situation/release.
Although Car 3 was required to slow down to avoid collision with Car 23, both cars
were moving slowly and were at no point in danger. Nor were any team personnel
placed in a position of danger.
In the circumstances, we considered that the release itself was untidy and could
potentially have resulted in an unsafe condition it did not in fact do so. As a result, we
decided to take no further action.
We nevertheless impressed upon the team that it was crucial that the safety of the
drivers and the team personnel in the pit lane be considered when releasing cars
from the garage and to therefore be extra vigilant when doing so. We also impressed
upon them the fact that such actions should not be repeated as a way of gaining a
competitive advantage.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
