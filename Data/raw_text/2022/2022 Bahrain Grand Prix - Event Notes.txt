EVENT NOTES
General Instructions
1) Pit lane map
1.1 Safety Car lines.
1.2 The location of the pit entry and the pit exit.
1.3 Designated garage areas.
1.4 Safety Car position for first lap and rest of race.
1.5 Blue flag marshal at the pit exit.
1.6 Track light panels displaying pit entry status.
2) Pirelli Event Preview
2.1 With reference to Article 30.5(a) of the Sporting Regulations see the attached document provided by
the official tyre supplier.
3) Red zones for photographers in the pit lane during practice sessions
3.1 See the attached drawing.
4) Track light panels
4.1 The FIA track light panels have been installed in the positions shown on the circuit map. In
accordance with Appendix H to the ISC the light signals have the same meaning as flag signals.
5) Track light panel displaying pit entry status
5.1 The light panels indicated on the pit lane map will display a flashing yellow arrow if cars are required
to use the pit lane once the Safety Car has been deployed during the race.
5.2 The light panels indicated on the pit lane map will display a flashing red cross if the pit lane is closed
at any point during the race.
6) Drivers leaving their pit stop position in the pit lane
6.1 For safety reasons, no car should be driven from its pit stop position at any time unless:
a) It has first been driven into the pit stop position having just entered the pit lane from the track,
and;
b) It is then driven immediately back onto the track from the pit stop position.
7) Observing yellow flags during free practice and qualifying
7.1 Double waved: Any driver passing through a double waved yellow marshalling sector must reduce
speed significantly and be prepared to change direction or stop. In order for the stewards to be
satisfied that any such driver has complied with these requirements it must be clear that he has not
attempted to set a meaningful lap time, for practical purposes this means the driver should abandon
the lap (this does not necessarily mean he has to pit as the track could well be clear the following
lap).
7.2 Single waved: Drivers should reduce their speed and be prepared to change direction. It must be
clear that a driver has reduced speed and, in order for this to be clear, a driver would be expected
to have braked earlier and/or discernibly reduced speed in the relevant marshalling sector.
Drivers should not overtake any car in a single waved yellow marshalling sector unless it is clear that
a car is slowing with a completely obvious problem, e.g. obvious accident damage or a deflated tyre.
8) In laps during qualifying and reconnaissance laps
8.1 In order to ensure that cars are not driven unnecessarily slowly on in laps during and after the end
of qualifying or during reconnaissance laps when the pit exit is opened for the race, drivers must stay
below the maximum time set by the FIA between the Safety Car lines shown on the pit lane map.
You will be informed of the maximum time after the first day of practice.
9) Parc Fermé Cameras
9.1 To assist with the revised FIA Event procedures, the Parc Fermé cameras must be uncovered and
operational at all times during the Event.
10) Operational personnel curfew
10.1 Boards warning anyone attempting to enter the paddock that the curfew is in operation will be placed
immediately before the turnstiles at the appropriate times.
11) Lapping during the race
11.1 The ISC requires drivers who are caught by another car about to lap him to allow the faster driver
past at the first available opportunity. The F1 Marshalling System has been developed in order to
ensure that the point at which a driver is shown blue flags is consistent, rather than trusting the ability
of marshals to identify situations that require blue flags.
As it was at the end of last season the system will be set to give a pre-warning when the faster car
is within 3.0s of the car about to be lapped, this should be used by the team of the slower car to warn
their driver he is soon going to be lapped and that allowing the faster car through should be
considered a priority. When the faster car is within 1.2s of the car about to be lapped blue flags will
be shown to the slower car (in addition to blue light panels, blue cockpit lights and a message on the
timing monitors) and the driver must allow the following driver to overtake at the first available
opportunity.
It should be noted that the aim of using F1MS is to ensure consistent application of the rules,
additional instructions may also be given by race control when necessary.
Event Specific Instructions
12) Formula 1 Sporting Regulations Article 23.1
12.1 In accordance with the provisions of Article 23.1a), this Event is an Open Event.
13) Changes to the circuit
13.1 No changes to the event in 2021.
14) Specific Technical Procedures
14.1 Please note that from 2022 the FIA have introduced an Appendix Index File which contains all the
relevant and active Appendix documents, Technical and Sporting Directives. The latest version of
this Index file (“2022 Formula 1 Appendix – iss 5 – 2022-03-16.xlsx”) and all relevant documents can
be found on the FIA SFTP site.
15) Support Races
15.1 Team Barrier placement
a) Team barrier placement prior to and during all support category practice sessions and races:
No more than four metres from the garages.
b) It is not permitted to push cars to the weighing area at any time a support category is in pit
lane.
15.2 Support Category Movements
a) Support Crews and Trolleys will be released into Pit Lane no earlier than 20 minutes prior to
the opening of Pit Exit for their respective sessions.
b) Support Category competition vehicles will be released from the marshalling area no earlier
than 15 minutes prior to the opening of Pit Exit for their respective sessions.
16) Practice starts
16.1 Practice starts may only be carried out on the right-hand side (concrete apron area) after the pit exit
lights but before the end of the pit signalling wall. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes any time
the pit exit is open for the race.
Drivers must leave adequate room on their left for another driver to pass.
16.2 For reasons of safety and sporting equity, cars may not stop in the fast lane at any time the pit exit
is open without a justifiable reason (a practice start is not considered a justifiable reason).
16.3 Additionally, Practice starts may be carried out on the track at the end of each free practice session.
Any car on the track when the chequered flag is shown may then complete another lap and, instead
of entering the pits, proceed to the grid and carry out a practice start.
16.4 All drivers carrying out a practice start must do so by pulling as far forward on the grid as possible
and, if necessary, should wait for others to carry out a start before getting to a grid position further
forward. Under no circumstances should a driver make a practice start if another car is still stationary
in front of him on the same side of the grid.
16.5 If any driver appears to be disregarding any of the above a red flag will be displayed and the
possibility to carry out any further starts will be immediately terminated.
17) Lines or bollards at the Pit Entry and Pit Exit
17.1 In accordance with Chapter 4 (Section 5) of Appendix L to the ISC drivers must keep to the right of
the solid white line at the pit exit when leaving the pits.
17.2 For safety reasons drivers must keep to the right of the bollard at the pit entry when they are entering
the pits.
17.3 Except in the cases of force majeure (accepted as such by the Stewards), the crossing by any part
of the car, in any direction, of the red and white painted area, between the pit entry and the track, by
a driver who, in the opinion of the Stewards, had committed to entering the pit lane is prohibited.
17.4 The dotted white line across the pit entry and the pit exit is the track edge line.
18) DRS
18.1 DRS Detection will be automatically disabled in each individual zone if any of the light panels in that
particular zone are displaying yellow. The zone and corresponding light panels are as follows:
a) Zone 1: Panels 3, 4
b) Zone 2: Panels 11, 12
c) Zone 3: Panels 18, 1, 2
19) Track Limits
In accordance with the provisions of Article 33.3, the white lines define the track edges.
20) Fire extinguishers around the circuit
20.1 Indicated by white boards with a red fire extinguisher image attached to the debris fences and
barriers.
21) Places to remove cars from the track
21.1 Indicated by fluorescent orange panels on the barriers.
21.2 Should a car stop on the track during a session, the driver must keep all of their protective clothing
(Helmet, Gloves, etc) on until they have returned to their garage.
22) Removing cars from the grid
22.1 Through the two gates in the pit wall, the first located adjacent to grid position 2 and the 2nd located
adjacent to grid position 18.
23) Car number light panels for the start
23.1 On the right-hand side of the grid.
24) Post-race parc fermé
24.1 All cars must enter the pit lane and, with the exception of the first three, should be driven directly to
the weighing area at the pit entry. The first three must follow the post-race procedure which will be
distributed prior to the start of the race.
