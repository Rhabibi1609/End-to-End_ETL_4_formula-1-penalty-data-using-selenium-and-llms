From The Stewards Document 39
To The Team Manager, Date 30 October 2022
Williams Racing
Time 17:03
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 33) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 6 - Nicholas Latifi
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 13:22
Session Reconnaissance Laps
Fact Driving unnecessarily slowly
Offence Failure to follow the Race Director’s instruction (point 4.1 Race Director’s event
notes) and alleged breach of Article 12.2.1.i of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Warning
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 6 (Nicholas Latifi) and team
representative.
The Race Director’s Note to Teams (document 16) specified a maximum time of
1:36.0 between the Safety Car lines and car 20 recorded a time of 1:37.212.
The driver of car 6, Latifi, was on his recon lap when he came up to Magnussen’s
car, which had a technical fault. When he arrived at Magnussen’s car he was 5 sec
ahead of the required lap time. He slowed considerably, but when he realized that
Magnussen was not going to speed up, Latifi then moved to pass him. This slowing,
however, caused him to miss the maximum lap time of 1:36.000 in the Race
Director’s instructions. The Stewards consider that he drove with due caution.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
