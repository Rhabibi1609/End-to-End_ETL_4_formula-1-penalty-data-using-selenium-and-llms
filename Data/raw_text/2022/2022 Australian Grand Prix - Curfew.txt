Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last Wednesday personnel of the Haas F1 Team, who are associated with the operation of the car,
were within the confines of the circuit during the thirteen hour period which commenced at 19:00 on
06 April, fourtytwo hours before the scheduled start time of P1 and ends twentynine hours before the
scheduled start time of P1 at 08:00 on 07 April.
This was the first of the eight individual exceptions permitted for the Haas F1 Team during the 2022
Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
