From The Stewards Document 47
To The Team Manager, Date 09 July 2022
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 18:37
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 38) and
heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter, and determine the
following:
No / Driver 5 - Sebastian Vettel
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 19:30
Session Qualifying
Fact Behaviour during the Drivers’ Meeting at 19:30 on 8 July.
Offence Breach of Article 12.2.1 f) of the International Sporting Code and Article 20.1 of the
FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Fine of €25,000 – Suspended.
Reason The driver, Sebastian Vettel, left the drivers’ meeting that was held at 19:30 on Friday
8 July, without permission, and expressing frustration at the meeting.
Drivers are not free to leave when they want, this being a breach of the requirement
to attend. Drivers at this level are role models for every driver around the world and in
the opinion of the Stewards Vettel failed to live up to that standard in this case.
Subsequently Vettel had a meeting with the Race Director, who informed the
Stewards that Vettel apologized without reservation, and that further, they had a very
constructive conversation covering the topics in the meeting and more. The Stewards
determine that there is a breach, which cannot go without penalty, but that based on
the report from the Race Director there are factors in mitigation.
Therefore, the Stewards order a fine of €25,000, which is suspended for the
remainder of the 2022 season, subject to any breach of Article 20.1 of the FIA
Formula One Sporting Regulations or of Article 12.2.1 f) of the International Sporting
Code.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
