gaining a lasting advantage.
Offence Breach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty
1 penalty point (total of 2 for the 12 month period).

in front of Car 20 going into turn 12, it was only able to retain that position by leaving
the track and returning to it alongside Car 20 then used its speed to pull ahead.
