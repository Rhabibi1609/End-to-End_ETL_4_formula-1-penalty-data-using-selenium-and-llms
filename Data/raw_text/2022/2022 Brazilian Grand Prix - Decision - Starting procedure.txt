Decision
The Stewards reviewed the start sequence, as it was observed that multiple cars were potentially out
of their grid box in violation of Article 8.6.1.a) of the FIA International Sporting Code, being either to
the left or right of the grid box. Having reviewed all available angles of video, and making
measurements on the grid, the Stewards noted that the grid boxes were slightly smaller than usual
and that the driversâ€™ visibility makes compliance extremely difficult and that no driver was in a position
that gained any advantage. The Stewards are therefore satisfied to take no further action.
