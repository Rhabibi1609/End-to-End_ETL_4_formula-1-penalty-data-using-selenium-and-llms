Time 18:57
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 18 & 19)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 17:51
Session Practice 1
Fact Impeding of Car 47 by Car 23 between turns 8 & 9.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver
This is the driverâ€™s 1st Reprimand of the Season (Driving)
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 23 (Alexander Albon), the driver of Car 47
(Mick Schumacher) and team representatives, and examined video, team radio
evidence and found that Car 23 impeded Car 47 who was on a fast lap.
Car 23 was informed that Car 47 was approaching and admitted that he saw him in
his mirror(s) but chose not to slow down and let him pass as he was concerned about
locking up his brakes. While the current incident did not result in an unsafe situation, it
did impede Car 47 during its fast lap and this is a breach of the regulations.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
