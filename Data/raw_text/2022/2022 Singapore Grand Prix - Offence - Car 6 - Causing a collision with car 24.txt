The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 6 - Nicholas Latifi
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 21:22
Session Race
Fact Collision with car 24 at turn 5.
Offence Breach of Article 2 d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 grid place penalty to be served at the Driverâ€™s next competition.
2 penalty points (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that LAT was
predominantly to blame for the collision. ZHO was attempting to overtake LAT on a
straight approaching turn 5 and had sufficient room, taking the normal racing line. LAT
pulled to the left, not leaving one car width to ZHO and resulting in significant contact
between the cars.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
