Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the the Scuderia Ferrari team, the McLaren F1 Team and the Williams
Racing team, who are associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit
during the eleven hour period which commenced at 23:00 on 20 May, fourteen hours before the
scheduled start time of P3 and ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 10:00 on
21 May.
This was the first of the two individual exceptions permitted for the Scuderia Ferrari team, the
McLaren F1 Team and the Williams Racing team during the 2022 Formula One Championship
season and therefore no action should be taken.
