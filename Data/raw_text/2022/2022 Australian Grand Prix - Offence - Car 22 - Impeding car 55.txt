The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 25 & 26)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 16:20
Session Practice 2
Fact Impeding of Car 55 by Car 22 at turn 2.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driverâ€™s 2nd Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda), the driver of Car 55
(Carlos Sainz) and team representatives and examined video evidence.
TSU exited pit lane and entered turns 1 and 2 knowing SAI was quickly approaching
on a push lap. After entering turns 1 and 2, SAI came up behind TSU, who was
moving slowly on the racing line at turn 2 and was, therefore, impeded.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
