The Stewards, having now received reports from the Technical Delegate (Documents 34 & 35),
have considered the following matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 77 - Valtteri Bottas
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 11:30
Session Practice 2
Fact The following Restricted-Number Components have been used:
5th Gearbox Cases and Cassettes (GBX C & C)
Offence Breach of Article 29.2 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Decision 26 is cancelled and replaced by Drop of 5 Grid Positions.
Reason Following a clarification from the Technical Delegate (Documents 34 & 35), the
Stewards rescind their decision Document 26 (which imposed a 10 place grid penalty,
and is hereby recalled) and impose a 5 place grid penalty instead.
The earlier reports indicated that the Competitor had changed the Gearbox Driveline,
Gear Change Components and Auxiliary Components (GBX DL) for a fifth time, while
also changing the Gearbox Cases and Cassettes (GBX C&C). It was later clarified
by the Technical Delegate that only the GBX C&C was changed, and the Stewards
make this decision to correct the earlier decision.
