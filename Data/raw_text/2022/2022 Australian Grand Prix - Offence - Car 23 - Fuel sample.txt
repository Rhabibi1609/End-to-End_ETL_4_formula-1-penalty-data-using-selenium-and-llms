The Stewards, having received a report from the Technical Delegate (document 49), summoned
(document 50) and heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 19:13
Session Qualifying
Fact A 1.0 litre sample of fuel was not able to be taken.
Offence Breach of Article 6.5.2 of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.
Decision Car 23 is disqualified from the results of Qualifying â€“ Article 12.4.1 m) FIA
International Sporting Code.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative.
After Qualifying Car 23 had insufficient fuel to yield the required 1.0 litre sample.
Given this situation, Car 23 is not in compliance with the requirements of Article 6.5 of
the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations. According to Art. 6.5.2 competitors must
ensure that a 1.0 litre sample of fuel may be taken from the car at any time. The
procedure was followed however the 1.0 litre sample of fuel was unable to be taken.
The Stewards determine to apply the standard penalty for technical infringements.
Therefore they took into account, that it shall be no defence to claim that no
performance advantage was obtained.
The Stewards have received a request from Williams Racing to allow Car 23 to start
the race. The Stewards therefore grant permission for Car 23, Alex Albon to start the
race.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
