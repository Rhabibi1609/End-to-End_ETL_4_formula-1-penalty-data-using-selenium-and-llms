2022 MIAMI GRAND PRIX
5 - 8 May 2022
From The Stewards Document 24
To The Team Manager, Date 06 May 2022
BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 16:45
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 18 & 19)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 31 - Esteban Ocon
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 14:32
Session Practice 1
Fact Unsafe release of car 31.
Offence Breach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand of the driver (non-driving).
This is the driverâ€™s first Reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 31 (Esteban Ocon), the driver of Car 63
(George Russell), and team representatives, and examined video evidence.
Car 31 was released from the garage, then the mechanic, noticing the approach of
Car 63, signalled the driver to stop. However, the driver was focused on entering the
fast lane (as this was the first lap of practice) and did not see the signal to stop.
Accordingly, this is deemed a breach of the regulations for which the driver is
responsible and therefore a Reprimand is imposed. Based on the case of Sainz in
Bahrain 2022, this is regarded as a non-driving Reprimand.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
