The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 15:21
Session Race
Fact Car 11 run over the Ferrari wheel gun when exiting the pit box.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 34.14 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representatives and examined video.
The Stewards determined (i) that Ferrariâ€™s wheel gun allocated to the rear left wheel
was placed a bit further away from its usual position but still in the inner lane and (ii)
that Car 11 rejoined the fast lane after its pit stop as soon as possible. The Stewards
took into consideration the configuration of the pit lane which is particularly short and
thus decide not to take any further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
