2022 JAPANESE GRAND PRIX

Time 13:36
Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
During FP3 driver Alexander Albon, car number 23 used a mixed set of dry weather Medium Spec
tyres. Article 30.2 b) of the 2022 Formula One Sporting Regulation requires tyres to be used as
allocated by the FIA. Therefore I am referring this matter to the stewards of the meeting for their
consideration.
