From The Stewards Document 20

BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 16:48
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 15 & 16)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 14 - Fernando Alonso
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 14:34
Session Practice 1
Fact Impeding of Car 44 by Car 14 at turn 12.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driver’s 1st Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards reviewed video evidence and determined that the driver of car 14 was
driving slowly on the racing line between turn 12 and turn 13 and unnecessarily
impeded car 44, requiring car 44 to take avoiding action. Consistent with the drivers’
request for the Stewards to enforce impeding during P1 and P2 this season, the
Stewards issue a Reprimand (driving).
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
