2022 SAUDI ARABIAN GRAND PRIX
24 - 27 March 2022
From The Stewards Document 54
To The Team Manager, Date 27 March 2022
Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 22:33
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 20:30
Session Race
Fact Failure to serve a penalty during a pit stop.
Offence Breach of Article 54.4(c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drive through penalty
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that Car 24 came into the
pit lane and stopped. But thereafter, it was jacked up by the team. Article 54.4(c)
requires that “whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of a penalty in
accordance with Articles 54.3(a)…it may not be worked on until the car has been
stationary for the duration of the penalty”. Although the team did not work on the car
for 5 seconds after jacking the car up, the jacking up of the car itself would be
“working” on the car, which is prohibited by 54.4(c).
Article 54.4(e) gives the Stewards the discretion to disqualify a car for failure to
comply with Article 54.4(c). However, given that no work was done while the car was
jacked up, we considered that disqualification would be too harsh and outcome. We
therefore imposed a drive through penalty.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
