Offence Breach of Article 12.2.1.i) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Reprimand for the driver.
This is the driver’s 1st Reprimand of the season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 24 (Zhou Guanyu) and team
representative and reviewed video evidence.
Car 24 left the track at turn 9 and failed to keep completely to the left of the orange
bollard before re-joining the track. The driver explained that due to the climate
conditions (rain) he was not sure if he could stay to the left of the bollard and that
therefore he did not comply with the Race Director’s instructions in this instance. The
Stewards determine that this is a breach of the above regulation by car 24.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
