matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll

Session Race
Fact Alleged forcing another driver off the track in turn 4.
Offence Alleged breach of Appendix L Chapter IV 2 of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that STR was overtaking
NOR to the inside of turn 6. STR was fully alongside, with the nose slightly ahead of
the apex, and the driver remained in control of the car. Therefore the Stewards
determine that no further action is appropriate.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
