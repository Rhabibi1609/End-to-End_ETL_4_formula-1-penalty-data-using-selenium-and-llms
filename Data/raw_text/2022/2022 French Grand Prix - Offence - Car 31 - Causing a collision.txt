2 penalty points (total of 6 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that OCO is
predominantly to blame for the collision with TSU. OCO was attempting to overtake
TSU at the entry to T8. He lost control of the rear of the car and collided with TSU,
who had left enough space for an overtaking manoeuvre by OCO.

Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
