(document 25) and heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 13:36
Session Practice 3
Fact Failing to use a complete set of tyres as allocated.
Offence Breach of Article 30.2 b) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Williams F1 Team) is fined â‚¬1,000
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative, the Technical Delegate and the
F1 Technical Assistant. The team agreed with the report that 3 tyres from set 202
were used and 1 from set 203 and conceded this was a breach of the regulations.
Taking into account the Decision of the Stewards (Doc 28) from the 2022 Hungarian
Grand Prix which although relating to a different regulation, is a similar
administrative/operational error, the penalty is deemed to be appropriate.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
