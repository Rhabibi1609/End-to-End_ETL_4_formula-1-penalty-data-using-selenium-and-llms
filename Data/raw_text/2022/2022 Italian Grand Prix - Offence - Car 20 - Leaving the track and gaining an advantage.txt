Session Race
Fact Left the track and gained an advantage in T2.
Offence Breach of Article 2 c) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 Second Time Penalty.
1 penalty point (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence, radio calls and telemetry and determined
that Car 20 left the tack at Turn 1 and returned in front of Car 6, having been behind
that Car prior to Turn 1. Despite Car 6 later overtaking Car 20 it was determined that
Car 20 did not give back the position, rather Car 6 committed a genuine overtaking
move.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
