The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (Document 53) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 11 - Sergio Perez
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 21:30
Session Race
Fact Falling more than 10 car lengths of the Safety Car.
Offence Breach of 55.10 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving)
This is the driverâ€™s 1st reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 11 (Sergio Perez), the team
representative and have reviewed video evidence.
Article 55.10 of the FIA Formula 1 Sporting Regulations requires that the leader must
keep within 10 car lengths of the safety car once deployed until the lights are
extinguished.
Car 11 was the lead car on lap 10.
It was admitted while the lights of the safety car were still on, PER failed to keep within
10 car lengths of the safety car between the exit of turn 13 and turn 14.
When questioned during the hearing PER said that the conditions were very wet and
that it was very difficult to closely follow the safety car with little heat in his tyres and
brakes.
Although the track was wet in parts, we do not accept that the conditions were such
as to make it impossible or dangerous for PER to have maintained the required less
than 10 car length gap.
Nevertheless, we took into account the wet conditions and the difficulties highlighted
by PER as mitigatory circumstances for this incident and, accordingly, determine that
a reprimand ought to be imposed.
