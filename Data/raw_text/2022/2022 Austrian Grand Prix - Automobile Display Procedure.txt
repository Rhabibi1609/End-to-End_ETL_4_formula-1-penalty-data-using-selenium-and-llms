NOTE TO TEAMS: CAR DISPLAY PROCEDURES
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 19 of the Sporting regulations, please note the following
procedures for the Car Display at this event:
(cid:120) Between 12:00 and 13:00 on Friday, one car from each team must be positioned as shown in the
attached drawing, with the other car positioned and available for viewing inside your garage.
(cid:120) The car outside may be used for pit stop practice but when no pit stop practice is taking place the
car must return to the same position.
(cid:120) At any event where it is raining during this presentation, we would ask you to leave the cars in
position and use your grid easy ups.
(cid:120) There must be enough space around the car on display to allow people to move safely.
(cid:120) The following specific timings have been allocated to assist the media and avoid overlapping of
any presentations or Q&A sessions teams may wish to hold (any presentations are not
