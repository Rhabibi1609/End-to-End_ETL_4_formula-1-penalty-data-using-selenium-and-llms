The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 23 - Alexander Albon
Competitor Williams Racing
Time 16:43
Session Race
Fact Car 23 left the track at Turn 10 and gained a lasting advantage.
Offence Breach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
1 penalty point (total of 4 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that Car 23 was ahead of
Car 47 into Turn 10 however was unable to take the turn, and cut the chicane thus
staying ahead of Car 47. The Stewards are of the opinion that Car 23 would not have
been able to retain its position had it stayed on track and note this is consistent with
the decision taken in relation to Car 24 at the 2022 Saudi Arabia Grand Prix.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
