7 - 10 April 2022
From The Stewards Document 58
To The Team Manager, Date 09 April 2022
Scuderia Ferrari
Time 22:19
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 55) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 16 - Charles Leclerc
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari
Time 16:09
Session Qualifying
Fact Alleged driving unnecessarily slowly on an in lap during Qualifying.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
failing to observe the Race Director’s Note (Document 34).
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 16 (Charles Leclerc) and team
representative and reviewed timing evidence.
LEC started a lap that was intended to be a cool down lap, not an in lap, which would
not be subject to the minimum time restriction of the regulation. Part way through the
lap, the decision was made to come in. During the lap there was heavy traffic and
LEC took effort to ensure that he did not impede other drivers on push laps. These
efforts significantly slowed his lap time. As a result, the minimum time was breached.
The Stewards accept the driver’s rationale for his actions; find that he acted
reasonably under the circumstances; and, therefore, take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
