Time 18:54
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 31 - Esteban Ocon
Competitor BWT Alpine F1 Team
Time 18:04
Session Race
Fact Collision with Car 47 in turn 6.
Offence Breach of Article 2 (d) Chapter IV Appendix L of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty
2 penalty points (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed the video evidence and determined that OCO attempted to
overtake MSC during lap 1 to the inside approaching turn 6. Although OCO backed
out as MSC turned in, the front left of OCO’s car made contact with the right rear of
MSC’s car, causing MSC to spin and continue. It was considered that the move was
not done in a safe and controlled manner by OCO. Therefore the Stewards determine
that this is a breach of the above regulation by OCO.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
