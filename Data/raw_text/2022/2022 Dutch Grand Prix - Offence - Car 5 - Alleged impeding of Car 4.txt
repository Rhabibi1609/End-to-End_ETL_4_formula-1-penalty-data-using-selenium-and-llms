From The Stewards Document 20
To The Team Manager, Date 02 September 2022
Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 16:53
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (Documents 17 & 18)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 5 - Sebastian Vettel
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco Cognizant F1 Team
Time 13:28
Session Practice 1
Fact Allegedly unnecessary impeding of Car 4 by Car 5 at turns 12-13.
Offence Alleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 5 (Sebastian Vettel), the driver of Car 4
(Lando Norris) and team representatives and examined video and radio evidence.
The Stewards determined that Car 4 was approaching turn 11 at higher speed than
Car 5, slowed down and stayed behind Car 5 until turn 13 where the driver of Car 4
decided to overtake Car 5. Car 4 was finishing a long run while Car 5 was preparing
for a last fast lap. During the hearing, both drivers and team representatives
recognized that it is well understood that impeding during free practice should be
looked at in a more lenient way by the Stewards unless it is a dangerous manoeuvre.
Both drivers also highlighted that the configuration of the track is propitious for
impeding and that Car 4 was not significantly impacted by the action. Therefore, the
Stewards decided to take no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
