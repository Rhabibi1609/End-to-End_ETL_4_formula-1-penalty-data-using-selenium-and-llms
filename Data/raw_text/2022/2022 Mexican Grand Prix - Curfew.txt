Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, who are associated
with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the ten and a half hours
period which commenced at 22:30 on 28 October, thirteen and a half hours before the scheduled
start time of P3 and ends three hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 09:00 on 29 October.
This was the second of the two individual exceptions permitted for the Mercedes-AMG Petronas
Formula One Team during the 2022 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action
should be taken.
