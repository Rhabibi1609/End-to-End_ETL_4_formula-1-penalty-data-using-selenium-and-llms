From The Stewards Document 15
To The Team Manager, Date 18 March 2022
Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 20:19
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 9 & 10) and
heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 18:48
Session Practice 2
Fact Impeding of Car 16 by Car 22 in Turn 8.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand for the driver
This is the driverâ€™s 1st Reprimand of the Season (Driving)
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda), the driver of Car 16
(Charles Leclerc) and team representatives, and examined video, team radio
evidence.
Car 22 (TSU) impeded car 16 (LEC) who was on fast lap with new tyres at turn 8,
causing car 8 to abandon his lap. Driver 22 says he was pushing on an out lap for a
long, high fuel run. However, the Stewards consider that a driver on an out lap must
always be aware of faster cars approaching and although this did not create a
dangerous situation they determine that this is a breach of the above regulation and
they impose a Reprimand in this case.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
