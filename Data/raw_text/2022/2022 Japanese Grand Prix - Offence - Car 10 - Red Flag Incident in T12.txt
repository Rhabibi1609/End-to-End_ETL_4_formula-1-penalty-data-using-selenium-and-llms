From The Stewards Document 46
To The Team Manager, Date 09 October 2022
Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 18:45
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (Document 43) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 10 - Pierre Gasly
Competitor Scuderia AlphaTauri
Time 14:08
Session Race
Fact Speeding under Red Flag Conditions.
Offence Breach of Article 57.2 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drive through penalty imposed after the end of the race.
(20 seconds added to elapsed race time).
2 penalty points (total of 9 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 10 (Pierre Gasly) and team
representative and reviewed video and telemetry evidence.
After passing the scene of the incident, car 10 continued under the red flag situation,
at speeds which exceeded 200 km/h on multiple occasions, and which reached 251
km/h at one point. The driver conceded that he now understood that there could have
been marshals or obstacles on the track,and admitted that he was too fast.
However, in mitigation of penalty, we take into account that although the speed could
not by any measure be regarded as “slow” as required in the regulations, it was
slower that the maximum speed that could be achieved under these conditions. We
also take into account the shock the driver experienced on seeing a truck on the
racing line in the corner of the incident.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
