Offence Breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and failing to
observe the Race Director’s Note (Document 34).
Decision Reprimand.
This is the driver’s 3rd Reprimand of the Season (Driving).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda) and team
representatives and reviewed timing evidence and footage from the onboard camera.
TSU drove a slow in lap at the end of the session without other traffic that impacted
his driving. The required minimum lap time was breached without good or apparent
reason. The Stewards, therefore, reprimand him for breaching the regulation.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
