2022 MONACO GRAND PRIX
26 - 29 May 2022
From The Stewards Document 40
To The Team Manager, Date 28 May 2022
Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 16:08
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 24 - Zhou Guanyu
Competitor Alfa Romeo F1 Team ORLEN
Time 13:43
Session Practice 3
Fact Unnecessary impeding of Car 1 by Car 24 in Turns 15 and 16.
Offence Breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Formal Warning for the driver.
A fine of â‚¬10,000 is imposed on the Competitor,
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 24 (Zhou Guanyu) and team
representative and examined video and radio evidence.
The Team advised the driver of the approach of Car 6 but made no mention of Car 1.
The driver of Car 24 appropriately let Car 6 pass, but being unaware of the approach
of Car 1 also approaching, unnecessarily impeded that car. The Team admitted it
was at fault and taking into consideration the lack of rearward visibility in various parts
of this circuit, the Stewards impose the lesser penalty of a formal Warning on the
driver.
As previously noted, the Stewards stress the importance of accurate and swift
communication between the teams and their drivers, and note that drivers must
exercise care in where they position their cars, and their respective speeds, during
Qualification.
The Stewards impose a lesser fine in this case, to that in Document 39, because in
this case there was a lack of information, in the former case the was significant
wrong information.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
