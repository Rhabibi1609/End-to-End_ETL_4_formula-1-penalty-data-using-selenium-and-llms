Session Race
Fact Car 30 collided with Car 18 in turn 2.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
1 penalty point (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence.
Car 30 overtook Car 18 in Turn 1, however lost momentum by missing the apex, then
Car 18 having taken a better exit was in front at the entry to Turn 2 and was entitled to
racing room at that corner. However Car 30 collided with the rear axle of Car 18,
causing a collision and forcing Car 18 to compromise the exit of the corner.
As there was only minor contact this was considered in mitigation and hence a 5
second penalty was imposed.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
