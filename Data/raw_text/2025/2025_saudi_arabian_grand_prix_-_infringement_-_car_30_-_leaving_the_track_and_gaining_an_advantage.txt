The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 30 - Liam Lawson
Competitor Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team
Time 20:50
Session Race
Fact Car 30 left the track at turn 2 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
(10 seconds added to elapsed Race time)
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that Car 30 (Lawson)
attempted to overtake Car 7 (Doohan) and in doing so left the track.
While he completed the overtake before turn 1, the speed that he carried into the turn
meant that he could not navigate turn 1 without leaving the track. He therefore could
not successfully overtake Car 7 without leaving the track and thereby gained a lasting
advantage which he did not give back.
The standard penalty of 10 seconds was therefore applied.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
