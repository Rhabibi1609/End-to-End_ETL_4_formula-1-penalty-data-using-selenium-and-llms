Session Race
Fact Overtaking under Safety Car conditions after the chequered flag.
InfringementBreach of Article 55.8 of the 2025 FIA Formula 1 Sporting Regulations.
Decision Driver: Warning.
Reason The driver overtook other cars after the chequered flag, but while Safety Car signals
were still being displayed, following an incident on the start/finish straight involving Car
4 (Lando Norris) and Car 81 (Oscar Piastri). While passing after the chequered flag
is not unusual, it is prohibited in the case of yellow flags, Safety Car or Virtual Safety
Car procedures. While the drivers were aware of where the incident was, they could
not have known if emergency equipment or marshals were being dispatched onto the
track, and so have to proceed with caution.
We are therefore warning the driver concerned, along with all other competitors.
Further breaches may incur higher penalties.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
