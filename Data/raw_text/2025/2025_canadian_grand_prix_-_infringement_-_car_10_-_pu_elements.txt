considered the following matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 10 - Pierre Gasly
Competitor BWT Alpine Formula 1 Team
Time 10:30
Session Qualifying
Fact The following Power Unit elements have been used:
3rd Energy Store (ES)
3rd Control Electronics (CE)
All Power Unit elements were replaced without the approval of the FIA Technical
Delegate during Parc Ferme.
InfringementBreaches of Articles 28.2 and 40.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Breach of Article 40.9 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Required to start the Race from the pit lane.
Reason The penalty is imposed in accordance with Article 28.3.
The use of each additional element in this case carries a 10 grid place penalty
therefore there is an accumulation of 20 places. Article 42.3 d) of the FIA Formula
One Sporting Regulations provides that a driver which has accrued more than 15
cumulative grid position penalties must start from the back of the grid.
However, as components were changed without the permission of the FIA Technical
Delegate Car 10 must therefore start the race from the pit lane as specified by Art.
40.9 (a).
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
