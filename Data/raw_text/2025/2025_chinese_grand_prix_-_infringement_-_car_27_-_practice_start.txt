The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 27 - Nico Hulkenberg
Competitor Kick Sauber F1 Team
Time 14:22
Session Reconnaissance Laps
Fact Practice start position
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Director’s Event Note (item 10, document 59) - Practice start infringement.
Decision Warning.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence and determined that Car 27 was out of position when conducting a practice
start compared with where the Race Director’s Event Note required such starts to be
made.
Reconnaissance laps are treated as laps within a practice session (as opposed to
the Race). No other cars were affected nor was this done in a dangerous manner.
We therefore administer a warning.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
