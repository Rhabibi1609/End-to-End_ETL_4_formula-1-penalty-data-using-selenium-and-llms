Time 15:59
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 38 & 40)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 30 - Liam Lawson
Competitor Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team
Time 12:54
Session Sprint
Fact Car 30 collided with Car 14 in Turn 12.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV Article 2 d) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty imposed after the Sprint.
1 penalty points (total of 6 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 14 (Fernando Alonso), the driver of Car
30 (Liam Lawson), team representatives and reviewed video and in-car video
evidence.
Car 30 was attempting an overtake on the outside of Car 14 into Turn 11. Although
being able to pull fully alongside, the front axle of Car 30 was not ahead of the front
axle of Car 14 at the apex as required per the Driving Standards Guidelines.
Therefore Car 30 was not entitled to be given room at the exit. Due to the layout of
the track, the car which has the right to the racing line in Turn 11 also has the right to
the racing line in Turn 12.
Car 30 drove to the very edge of the track between Turns 11 and 12 and collided with
Car 14 on the approach to Turn 12. The Stewards determine that Car 30 was
predominantly at fault and therefore consider a 5 seconds penalty to be appropriate
taking into account the track conditions.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
