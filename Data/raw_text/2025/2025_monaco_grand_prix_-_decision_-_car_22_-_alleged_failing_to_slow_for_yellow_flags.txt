The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 17:48
Session Practice 2
Fact Alleged failing to slow under yellow flags.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.5 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that the driver of Car 22 did
slow down for the yellow flags as required.
While we had initially indicated an intention to investigate the incident after the
session, our review of the telemetry established clearly that he had slowed down,
thereby rendering it unnecessary to investigate this further.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
