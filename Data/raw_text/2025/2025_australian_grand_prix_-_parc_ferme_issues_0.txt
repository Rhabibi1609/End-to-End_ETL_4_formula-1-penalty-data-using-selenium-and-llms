2025 AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX
14 - 16 March 2025
From The FIA Formula One Technical Delegate Document 34
To The Stewards Date 16 March 2025
Time 14:02
Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
The rear wing and rear beam wing of car number 30 were changed to ones of a different
specification. Therefore car number 30 should now be required to start the Race from the pit lane
according to Article 40.9 a) of the 2025 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
Jo Bauer
The FIA Formula One Technical Delegate
