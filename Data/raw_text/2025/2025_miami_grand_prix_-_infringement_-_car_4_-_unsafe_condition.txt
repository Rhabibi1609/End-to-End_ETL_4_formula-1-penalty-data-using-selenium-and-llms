From The Stewards Document 19
To The Team Manager, Date 02 May 2025
McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 15:20
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 13) and
heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter and determine the
following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 12:34
Session Practice 1
Fact Car 4 was released in an unsafe condition.
InfringementBreach of Article 34.14 c) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Warning to the Competitor.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative and reviewed video and radio
evidence.
The team admitted in the hearing that they made a genuine mistake by leaving two
torches/flashlights in the cockpit when releasing Car 4 from the garage. However, the
driver realised directly after entering the track that some equipment was in the car
and was able to secure both parts shortly after leaving the pit exit before returning
slowly to the pits.
The Stewards determine that the incident qualifies as a car being released in an
unsafe condition, but the driver realised the problem extremely quickly and reacted
adequately to prevent any unsafe or dangerous situation. This is taken into account in
mitigation and a Warning to the Competitor is issued.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
