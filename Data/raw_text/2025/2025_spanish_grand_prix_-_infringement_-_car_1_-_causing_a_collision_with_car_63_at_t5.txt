The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 16:33
Session Race
Fact Car 1 collided with Car 63 at turn 5.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
3 penalty points (total of 11 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
and in-car video evidence.
From the radio communications, it was clear that the driver of Car 1 was asked by his
team to ‘give the position back’ to Car 63 for what they perceived to be an earlier
breach by Car 1 for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage (in fact, we had
later determined that we would take no further action in relation to that incident).
The driver of Car 1 was clearly unhappy with his team’s request to give the position
back. At the approach to Turn 5, Car 1 significantly reduced its speed thereby
appearing to allow Car 63 to overtake. However, after Car 63 got ahead of Car 1 at
the entry of Turn 5, Car 1 suddenly accelerated and collided with Car 63.
The collision was undoubtedly caused by the actions of Car 1. We therefore imposed
a 10 second time penalty on Car 1.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
