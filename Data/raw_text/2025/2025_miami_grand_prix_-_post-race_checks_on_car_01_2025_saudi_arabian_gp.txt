Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race in Jeddah, car number 01 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more
extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were the engine air intake system (TR Article 5.15) and the oil
and coolant system and charge air cooling (TR Article 7) as well as all attached sensors, their loom
routing and connections to the SECU and other units.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2025 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
