The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 52 & 53)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 87 - Oliver Bearman
Competitor MoneyGram Haas F1 Team
Time 15:17
Session Qualifying
Fact Alleged Impeding of car 18 in turn 13.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 87 (Oliver Bearman), the driver of Car 18
(Lance Stroll), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined
as follows.
STR informed us that although Car 87 came into the racing line after turn 13 he was
not impeded and his lap time was not impacted. We confirmed this from the telemetry.
While BEA acknowledged that with the benefit of hindsight he could have done more
to get out of the way, in the circumstances, he did his best not to impact STR, which
STR accepted.
We therefore took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
