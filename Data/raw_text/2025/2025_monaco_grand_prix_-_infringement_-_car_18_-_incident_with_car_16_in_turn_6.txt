To The Team Manager, Date 23 May 2025
Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 15:36
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 14 & 15)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 13:36
Fact Collision between Car 18 and Car 16 at Turn 6.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 1 grid position for the next Race in which the driver participates.
1 penalty point (total of 3 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 16
(Charles Leclerc), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that Car 18
cut across the path of Car 16 at Turn 6 causing Car 16 to collide into Car 18. Car 16
suffered damage as a result.
The driver of Car 18 stated that although the team warned him of the arrival of Car
16, he did not hear the radio message and that led to the incident. We considered
that Car 18 was wholly to blame for the collision. Car 16 was not in a position to avoid
the collision that took place.
In the circumstances, we imposed a 1 grid position penalty for the Race and 1 penalty
point.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
