2025 SPANISH GRAND PRIX
30 May - 01 June 2025
From The FIA Formula One Technical Delegate Document 26
To The Stewards Date 01 June 2025
Time 11:40
Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
The Oracle Red Bull Racing team has replaced the rear wing of car number 22 for one of a different
specification. Also changes to the set-up of car number 22 have been made.
Therefore car number 22 should now be required to start the Race from the pit lane according to
Article 40.9 a) of the 2025 Formula One Sporting Regulations.
I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
