Session Qualifying
Fact Car 31 failed to stay to the far right of the track between turns 12 and 13 as required
by the Race Directors Instruction
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Director’s Event Note (item 1, document 19).
Decision Driver: Reprimand (Driving).
This is the driver’s 1st reprimand of the season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 31 (Esteban Ocon), team representative
and reviewed, video evidence.
V2 of the Event Notes included a new instruction that during Qualifying drivers making
way for faster cars between turns 12 and 13 are required to move away from the
racing line to the to the far right side of the track.
When on a slow lap, OCO stayed on the left side of the track on the straight between
turns 12 and 13. Car 16 (Charles Leclerc) was on a push lap and had to overtake
Car 31 on the right where Car 31 ought to have been. Car 16 was not impeded in this
case. Nonetheless, Car 31 failed to comply with the clear instruction of the Race
Director. The driver of Car 31 acknowledged the infringement and apologised
explaining that the instruction was new, his main focus was to ensure that he gave a
clear path for Car 16 and he had overlooked the requirement to stay on the other side
of the track.
Having considered the matter extensively, the Stewards determined to impose a
reprimand on the driver of Car 31.
