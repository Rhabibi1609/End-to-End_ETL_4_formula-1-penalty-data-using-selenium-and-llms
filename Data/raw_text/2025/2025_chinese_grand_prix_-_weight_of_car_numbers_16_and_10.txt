Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the Race, car number 16 was weighed and its weight was 800.0 kg, which is the minimum
weight required by TR Article 4.1. As the front wing was damaged (the missing FW endplate was
recovered and weighed with the car), the car was re-weighed with an offical spare front wing
assembly of car 16 and its weight was 800.5 kg.
After this, fuel was drained out of the car and 2.0 litres of fuel were removed. The car was drained
according to the draining procedure submitted by the team in their legality document. The car was
weighed again on the FIA scales (with the offical spare front wing assembly of car 16) and the weight
was 799.0 kg. The calibration of the scales was confirmed and witnessed by the competitor. For
information the spare front wing was 0.2 kg heavier than the damaged one used during the race.
As this is 1.0 kg below the minimum weight requested in TR Article 4.1, which also has to be
respected at all times during the Competition, I am referring this matter to the Stewards for their
consideration.
After the Race, car number 10 was weighed and its weight was 800.0 kg, which is the minimum
weight required by TR Article 4.1. After this, a fuel mass check was carried out and 1.1 kg of fuel
were removed. The car was drained according to the draining procedure submitted by the team in
their legality document. The car was weighed again on the FIA scales and the weight was 799.0 kg.
The calibration of the scales was confirmed and witnessed by the competitor.
As this is 1.0 kg below the minimum weight requested in TR Article 4.1, which also has to be
respected at all times during the Competition, I am referring this matter to the Stewards for their
consideration.
