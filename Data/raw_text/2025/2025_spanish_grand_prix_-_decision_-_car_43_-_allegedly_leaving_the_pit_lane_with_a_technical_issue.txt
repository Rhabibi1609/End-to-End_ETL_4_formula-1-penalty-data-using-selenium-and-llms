matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 43 - Franco Colapinto
Competitor BWT Alpine Formula 1 Team
Time 16:15
Fact Allegedly leaving the pit lane while facing a technical issue with the car.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 12.2.1 h) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined
that Car 43 faced a technical issue with the car while in the fast lane of Q1. The team
and driver attempted to resolve the issue but failed to do so after a few attempts. The
driver then pulled over to the right hand side of the pit exit road, after crossing the pit
exit line and exited the car.
We did not consider that any rule or regulation had been infringed by the conduct of
the team or driver in attempting to resolve the technical issue, notwithstanding the fact
that they ultimately failed to do so.
We accordingly took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
