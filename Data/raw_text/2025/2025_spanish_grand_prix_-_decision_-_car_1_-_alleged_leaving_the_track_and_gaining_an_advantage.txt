The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 16:28
Session Race
Fact Car 1 left the track at turn 1 and allegedly gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementAlleged breach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing and in-car
video evidence.
Car 63 attempted to overtake Car 1 on the inside of Turn 1. While the front axle of
Car 63 was ahead of the mirror of Car 1 at the apex, the driver of Car 63
momentarily lost control of the car and collided with Car 1, forcing it wide and into the
escape road.
Car 1 re-entered the track at Turn 3 ahead of Car 63. Given that the reason for Car
1 being forced off the track was the loss of control and the resulting contact by Car
63, Car 1 did not deliberately leave the track.
We accordingly took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
