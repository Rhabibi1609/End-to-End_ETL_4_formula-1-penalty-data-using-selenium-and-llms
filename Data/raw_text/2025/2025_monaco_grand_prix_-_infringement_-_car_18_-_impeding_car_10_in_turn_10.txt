Time 18:26
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 30 & 31)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 18 - Lance Stroll
Competitor Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team
Time 16:08
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 18 impeded Car 10 in Turn 10.
InfringementBreach of Article 37.5 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Drop of 3 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 18 (Lance Stroll), the driver of Car 10
(Pierre Gasly), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence.
Car 18 was informed that Car 10 was arriving on a fast lap at Turn 10. From the radio
communications it appears that Car 18 was not informed/reminded that Car 44
(whom Car 18 had overtaken earlier in that lap) was also coming and that Car 44 was
going to overtake Car 18.
The driver of Car 18 assumed wrongly that there was only one car to be let by and
when Car 44 (which was not on a fast lap) went by him, he moved back to the racing
line thereby impeding Car 10 which was on a fast lap.
During the hearing, the driver of Car 18 stated that he could not tell the colour of the
car that had overtaken him because of the position of the sun, which we accepted.
He therefore wrongly assumed that there was no other car to be let by.
In the circumstances, we imposed the usual penalty of a drop of 3 grid positions.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
