The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 26) and
heard from the team representative, have considered the following matter and determine the
following:
No / Driver 27 - Nico Hulkenberg
Competitor Stake F1 Team Kick Sauber
Time 19:18
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 27 exceeded track limits at turn 11 during Q1.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L Chapter IV Article 2 c) of the FIA International Sporting Code
and non-compliance with the Race Director’s Event Notes, item 17, document 23.
Decision The lap time of 1:31.998 of Car 27 recorded in Q1 is deleted.
All lap times of Car 27 in Q2 are deleted.
Car 27 will therefore be classified in position 16 in Qualifying.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative and reviewed
positioning/marshalling system data, and video evidence.
During Q1, Car 27 clearly exceeded track limits in turn 11.
However this was not reported to the Stewards until Q2 had commenced. Car 27’s
time recorded on the lap that track limits were exceeded, was sufficient to place it in
Q2. Hence at the time the Stewards were informed that Car 27 had breached the
Race Directors Event Notes and that its lap should have been deleted, it was already
on track in Q2.
As this is an unusual situation, the Stewards have decided to settle the matter by
exercising their authority under Article 11.9.2.a of the FIA International Sporting
Code.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
