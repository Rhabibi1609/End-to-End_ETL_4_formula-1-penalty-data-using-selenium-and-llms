Time 15:29
Session Race
Fact The driver of Car 44 failed to maintain a 10 car-length distance behind the Safety
Car.
InfringementBreach of Article 55.7 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision No penalty is applied.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video and in-car video
evidence.
Although the gap to the previous car exceeded the 10 car lengths prescribed in the
regulations, the Stewards considered the weather conditions and also that the correct
gap was restored well prior to the restart, as mitigating circumstances in this case.
Hence no penalty is applied.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
