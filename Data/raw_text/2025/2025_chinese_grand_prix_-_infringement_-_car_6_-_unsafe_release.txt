Time 18:11
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 55 & 56)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 6 - Isack Hadjar
Competitor Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team
Time 15:56
Session Qualifying
Fact Car 6 was released into the path of Car 1 in the pit lane.
InfringementBreach of Article 34.14 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team) is fined €5,000.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 6 (Isack Hadjar), the driver of Car 1 (Max
Verstappen), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video and in-car video evidence and determine as follows.
The driver of Car 6 stated that he followed the instructions of his pit lane
representative (‘the Number 1’) and came out of the garage when requested to do so.
He was slightly late in exiting the garage but in any event it was clear that the release
was late and that resulted in Car 6 being released into the path of Car 1. The driver of
Car 1 had to take evasive action to avoid a collision or risk flat spotting his tyres if he
braked hard.
The team representative accepted that the team made a mistake in this instance.
We accordingly imposed a fine of €5,000 to the team.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
