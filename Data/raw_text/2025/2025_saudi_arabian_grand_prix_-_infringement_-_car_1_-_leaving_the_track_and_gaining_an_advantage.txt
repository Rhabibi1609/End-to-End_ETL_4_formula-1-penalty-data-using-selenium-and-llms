The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 1 - Max Verstappen
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 20:04
Session Race
Fact Car 1 left the track at turn 2 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry
and in-car video evidence and determined that car 81 had its front axle at least
alongside the mirror of Car 1 prior to and at the apex of corner 1 when trying to
overtake Car 1 on the inside. In fact, Car 81 was alongside Car 1 at the apex.
Based on the Driver’s Standards Guidelines, it was therefore Car 81’s corner and he
was entitled to be given room.
Car 1 then left the track and gained a lasting advantage that was not given back. He
stayed in front of Car 81 and sought to build on the advantage.
Ordinarily, the baseline penalty for leaving the track and gaining a lasting advantage is
10 seconds.
However, given that this was lap one and turn one incident, we considered that to be
a mitigating circumstance and imposed a 5 second time penalty instead.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
