Scuderia Ferrari HP
Time 19:05
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 37 & 38)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 16 - Charles Leclerc
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari HP
Time 16:28
Session Race
Fact Collision involving Car 1 and Car 16 on the start/finish straight.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 1 (Max Verstappen), the driver of Car 16
(Charles Leclerc), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, telemetry, team radio and in-car video evidence.
Car 1 lost traction while navigating Turn 14 and therefore had to defend his position
on track against Car 16. Car 16 proceeded to move to overtake Car 1 on the start
finish straight. Both cars were moving slightly towards each other in the middle of the
track and a minor collision occurred as a result.
Both drivers were of the view that this was an avoidable collision and could potentially
have resulted in a major crash but neither driver was wholly or predominantly to
blame.
In the circumstances, we took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
