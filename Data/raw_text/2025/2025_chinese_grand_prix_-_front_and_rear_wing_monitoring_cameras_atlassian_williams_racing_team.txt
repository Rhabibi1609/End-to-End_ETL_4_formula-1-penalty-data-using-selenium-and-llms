Time 17:52
Technical Delegate’s Report
The Atlassian Williams Racing team failed to provide the video files recorded by the wireless forward
and rearward facing cameras within one hour after the end of the first free practice session, as
described in the procedure “Additional Diagnostic” of the Technical Directive TD034L. The video
files recorded by these cameras are used to monitor compliance with the first paragraph of Article
3.2.2 and furthermore as referred to in Article 3.15.16 of the 2025 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
As this is not in compliance with Article 1.6 of the 2025 Formula One Technical Regulations, I am
referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
