The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 44 - Lewis Hamilton
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari HP
Time 17:33
Session Race
Fact Cars 44 and 55 collided in Turn 17.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed video, telemetry and in-car video evidence.
Car 55 attempted an overtake on the inside of Car 44 into Turn 17 and both cars
made contact at the apex. The Stewards determine that both drivers contributed to
the incident as Car 55 did not clearly get in a position to have the right to the racing
line according to the Driving Standards Guidelines and at the same time Car 44
turned into the corner earlier than usual and therefore impacted the driver of Car 55
in his overtaking attempt. No driver is deemed predominantly to blame for the collision
and therefore no further action is taken.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
