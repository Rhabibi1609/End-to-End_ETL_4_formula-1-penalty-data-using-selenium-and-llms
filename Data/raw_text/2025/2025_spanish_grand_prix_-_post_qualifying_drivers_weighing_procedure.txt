Technical Delegate’s Report
After the second Qualifying session, the driver Lance Stroll, car number 18, did not follow the post
Qualifying drivers weighing procedure as laid out in the Race Director’s Event Notes, item 13.
Firstly the driver stayed 5 minutes in the teams garage before proceeding to the scales and secondly
he did not proceed through the pit-lane.
I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
