Session Race
Fact Car 23 left the track at turn 1 and gained a lasting advantage.
InfringementBreach of Article 33.3 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, team radio
and in-car video evidence and determined that the driver of Car 30 (Lawson) was on
the inside of Turn 1, clearly ahead of Car 23 (Albon) at the apex of Turn 1 when Car
23 went off the track, into the side road.
By going off the track, Car 23 was able to get ahead of Car 30 and gain a position.
Car 30 did not give the position back and therefore gained a lasting advantage. We
imposed a 10 second time penalty on Car 23.

Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
