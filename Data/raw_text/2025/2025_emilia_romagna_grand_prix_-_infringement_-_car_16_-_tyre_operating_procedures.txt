InfringementBreach of Article 30.5 (a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision The competitor (Scuderia Ferrari HP) is fined €5,000.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative of Car 16 (Charles Leclerc) and
reviewed the technical data supplied by the Technical Delegate.
Technical Directive 003G, point 2 g.ii, specifies that a tyre may be used more than
once in a single session. It also sets out the procedures that must be followed if the
team wishes to make adjustments to the tyres such as reducing tyre pressures. It
requires that first, tyre temperatures must be obtained.
The Team Representative admitted that these procedures were not followed, which is
a breach of Article 30.5 a) of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. The
Stewards note that this was during a Free Practice session. In accordance with
similar operational tyre infringements in the past, the Stewards issue a fine of €5,000.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
