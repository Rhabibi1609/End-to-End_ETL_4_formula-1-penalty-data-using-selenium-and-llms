Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team, who are
associated with the operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the fourteen
(14) hour period which commenced at 17:30 on 03 April, eighteen (18) hours before the scheduled
start time of P1 and ends four (4) hours before the scheduled start time of P1 at 07:30 on 04 April.
This was the first of the three (3) individual exceptions permitted for the Mercedes-AMG
PETRONAS Formula One Team during the 2025 Formula One Championship season and therefore
no action should be taken.
