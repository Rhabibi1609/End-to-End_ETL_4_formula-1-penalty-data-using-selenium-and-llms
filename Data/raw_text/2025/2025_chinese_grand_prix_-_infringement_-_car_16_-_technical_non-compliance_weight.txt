determine the following:
No / Driver 16 - Charles Leclerc
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari HP
Time 18:28
Session Race
Fact Weight of Car 16 was below the minimum weight required (800 kg).
InfringementBreach of Article 4.1 of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.
Decision Car 16 is disqualified from the Race classification. All other drivers move up in the
classification.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative of Car 16 ( Charles Leclerc).
Car 16 was weighed by the FIA Technical Delegate using the FIA scales which
showed the result of 799 kg after the customary draining of fuel and the replacement
of a broken front wing. The calibration of the scales was confirmed and witnessed by
the competitor.
During the hearing there was no challenge to the FIAâ€™s measurements which are
taken to be correct and that all required procedures were performed correctly.
There are no mitigating circumstances and that the team confirmed that it was a
genuine error by them.
The Stewards determine that Article 4.1 of the FIA Formula 1 Technical Regulations
has been breached and therefore the standard penalty of a disqualification needs to
be applied for such an infringement.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
