Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Changes have been made to the set-up of the suspension of car number 30. Therefore car number
30 should now be required to start the Race from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 b) of the 2025
Formula One Sporting Regulations.
I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
