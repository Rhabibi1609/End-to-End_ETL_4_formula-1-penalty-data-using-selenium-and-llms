InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision 10 second time penalty.
2 penalty points (total of 4 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing and in-car
video evidence and determine as follows.
Car 7 (DOO) was overtaken by Car 6 (HAD) in the run up to Turn 14 and in trying to
take the position back on the inside, DOO lost control, locked up and forced HAD off
the track.
We accordingly imposed a 10 second time penalty with 2 penalty points which is in
keeping with the guidelines for forcing a driver off the track.
