Time 16:00
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 25) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 12:52
Session Practice 3
Fact Car 22 overtook Car 81 under red flag
InfringementBreach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.4.1 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision Drop of 10 grid positions for the next Race in which the driver participates.
2 penalty points (total of 2 for the 12 month period).
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry and in-car
video evidence.
Car 81 (Piastri) had earlier collided with the barrier at the exit of turn 14 and damaged
the rear right wheel and sustained a puncture and suspension damage. A red flag
was displayed when Car 22 was at turn 6. Car 22 reduced speed at that point. After
turn 12, Car 22 was approaching Car 81 on the back straight. The driver of Car 22
said that he saw Car 81 travelling slowly on the left side of the track with obvious
damage. He said that he was worried that he might be struck by debris from Car 81
and decided to overtake.
Telemtry showed that Car 81 was travelling at 86kph when Car 22 overtook at a
speed of 171kph.
Having considered the matter extensively, the Stewards determined that while Car 81
had an obvious problem, it was not travelling at such a speed that it prevented Car 22
from following it at a safe distance. The circumstances were such that there was no
justifiable reason for the driver of Car 22 to have overtaken Car 81.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
