Competitor Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team
Time 15:36
Session Race
Fact Car 30 allegedly collided with Car 23 at turn 1.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Articles 2 b) and 2 d) of the FIA
International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing and in-car
video evidence and determined that Car 30 (Lawson) was overtaking Car 23 (Albon)
on the outside at Turn 1 and was well ahead of Car 23 at the apex.
While defending, Car 23 collided with the rear of Car 30 suffering damage to its front
wing. The collision was not the fault of Car 30. We therefore took no furher action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
