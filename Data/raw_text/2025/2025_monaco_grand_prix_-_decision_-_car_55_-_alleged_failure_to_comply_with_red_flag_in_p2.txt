Time 14:50
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 27) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 55 - Carlos Sainz
Competitor Atlassian Williams Racing
Time 17:06
Session Practice 2
Fact Car 55 overtook Car 43 under red flag.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix H, Article 2.5.4.1 b) of the International Sporting Code.
Decision No Further Action.
Reason This was an alleged infringement was only reported to the Stewards the next day,
after the FP3 session was concluded.
The Stewards thereafter heard from the driver of Car 55 (Carlos Sainz), team
representative and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, telemetry, video,
timing, team radio and in-car video evidence and determined that Car 55 overtook
Car 43 at Turn 2.
As Car 55 was going towards Turn 2, the session was red flagged. Car 55 was very
close to Car 43 when that happened (42 metres).
Car 55 was travelling at a significant speed, in excess of 250kph. Car 43, on the
other hand, was on a slow lap on the left hand side of the track.
As soon as the red flag was shown, Car 55 took immediate steps to slow down in a
safe manner as required under Article 2.5.4.1 b) of Appendix H to the International
Sporting Code. There was a significant speed delta between the two cars and the
overtake was an inevitable consequence of that speed delta and the distance
between the cars.
In the circumstances, we took no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
