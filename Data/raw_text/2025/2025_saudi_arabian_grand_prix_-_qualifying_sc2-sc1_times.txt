The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter
and determine the following:
Session Qualifying
Fact The car below exceeded the 1:50.0 time limit between the Safety Car lines.
No Car Driver Competitor Time of Day Lap
1 44 Lewis Hamilton Scuderia Ferrari HP 20:10:16 L5 (Q1)
Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 2, document 8)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras.
The driver concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:50.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, in this case the Stewards
determined that the driver took appropriate actions to not impede other drivers,
and slowed down significantly to allow other drivers to pass while giving those
drivers a clear track. The Stewards therefore determine that the driver concerned
did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and that they were above the maximum time
because they took appropriate steps, and we therefore take no further action.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
