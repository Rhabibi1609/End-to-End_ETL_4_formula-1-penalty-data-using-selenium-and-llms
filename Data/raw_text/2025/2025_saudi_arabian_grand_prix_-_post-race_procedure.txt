NOTE TO TEAMS: POST-RACE INTERVIEWS & PODIUM CEREMONY PROCEDURE
In addition to the provisions of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations – Appendix 5 Podium Ceremony,
the Podium Ceremony procedure detailed below must be followed.
Post-Race Interview and Podium Ceremony Procedure:
• The master of ceremonies will be appointed by the FIA to conduct and take responsibility for the
entire podium ceremony.
• Drivers who finish the race in the top three positions will be required to stop on the grid in the vicinity
of grid position 13 where they will find the boards showing positions from 1, 2, 3.
• Other than the team mechanics (with cooling fans if necessary), officials, FIA pre-approved television
crews and photographers, no one else will be allowed in the designated area at this time (no team
PR personnel, driver physios must wait outside the cool down room until the podium ceremony has
concluded following the instructions given to all teams by the Media Delegate).
• Once parked, the top three (3) cars should be pushed back to the FIA Garages through the
Pit Wall gate in the vicinity of grid position 24 (opposite the McLaren garage).
• Competitors are reminded of Article 63.2 of the Sporting Regulations – “For the duration of the Post
Race Interviews and Podium Ceremony Procedure, the Drivers finishing in race in positions 1, 2, 3
must remain attired only in their Driving Suits, 'done up' to the neck, not opened to the waist.”
• Drivers will be weighed by the FIA. Each Driver must be fully attired while they are weighed (e.g.:
Helmet, Gloves, etc.). Water will be available in the parc fermé area after the driver has been
weighed.
• The post-race interviews will take place on the grid, and the interviewer will be selected by the
Commercial Rights Holder.
• Drivers must not interfere with parc fermé protocols in any way.
• Once the interviews have been completed, the Drivers will be immediately escorted to the cool down
room. Each Driver will be given their Pirelli Cap.
• The drivers will then be escorted to the Podium area where the 1, 2, 3 Rostrum and Dias will be
located.
• When the Drivers are ready, an announcement for the Podium Ceremony will take place with the 3rd
and 2nd placed Drivers introduced to move to their respective Podium Dias steps.
• The Winning Driver will then be announced who will move to his position on the Podium.
• The National Anthems will then take place and flags will be displayed.
• Dignitaries will present the trophies on the podium as arranged by the Master of Ceremonies.
• Each driver or representative must accept their trophy and presentations will take place in the
following order:
Winning Driver
o
1
FIA Medal for the Winning Driver
o
A representative of the Winning Constructor
o
2nd Place Driver
o
3rd Place Driver
o
• Following the Podium Ceremony, the top three (3) drivers will be escorted by the FIA Media Delegate
to the TV pen.
• At the end of the TV pen, the top three (3) drivers will be escorted to the FIA Press Conference.
• Drivers from 4th and beyond must proceed directly to the TV pen after they have been weighed in
the Parc Fermé. Each Driver must remain fully attired until after they have been weighed (e.g.:
Helmet, Gloves, etc.).
• Any Driver from 4th and beyond who does not have a session for the written media organised after
the race must be available for interview at the written media zone adjacent to the TV pen once their
TV interviews have concluded.
• Drivers who retire during the race are required to go to the TV pen (and written media pen if they do
not have a session for the written media organised after the race) as soon as they have come back
into the paddock.
