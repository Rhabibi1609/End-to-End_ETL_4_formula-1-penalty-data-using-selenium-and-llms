The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 22 - Yuki Tsunoda
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 20:04
Session Race
Fact Car 22 allegedly caused a collision with Car 10 in Turn 5.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 22 (Yuki Tsunoda), the driver of Car 10
(Pierre Gasly), team representatives and reviewed positioning/marshalling system
data, video, timing, telemetry and in-car video evidence and determined that this was
a first lap racing incident.
Car 22 and Car 10 were battling for track position on the first lap. They navigated four
corners without incident but collided on Turn 5.
Both parties agreed that this was a lap one incident with no party wholly or
predominantly to blame. Although we considered whether this was properly a lap one
incident or really an incident between two cars (and no others) on lap one.
Ultimately, given the narrow track and the fact that Car 55 was just in front of Car 22,
led us to agree with the assessment of both drivers that this should be treated as a
lap one incident with no further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
