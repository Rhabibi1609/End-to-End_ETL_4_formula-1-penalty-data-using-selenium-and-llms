The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following matter
and determine the following:
Session Sprint Qualifying
Fact The cars below exceeded the 1:45.0 time limit between the Safety Car lines.
No Car Driver Competitor Time of Day Lap
1 55 Carlos Sainz Atlassian Williams Racing 16:41:21 L5 (SQ1)
2 63 George Russell Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team 16:41:27 L5 (SQ1)

Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 1, document 10)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras.
The drivers concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:45.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, in all cases the Stewards
determined that the drivers took appropriate actions to not impede other drivers
and slowed down significantly to allow other drivers to pass while giving those
drivers a clear track or had already taken the chequered flag. The Stewards
therefore determine that the drivers concerned did not drive “unnecessarily
slowly”, and that evidently the reason they were above the maximum time was
due to their appropriate actions and take no further action.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
