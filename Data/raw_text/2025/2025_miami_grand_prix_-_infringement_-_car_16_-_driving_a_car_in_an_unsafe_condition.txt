Time 15:53
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 43) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 16 - Charles Leclerc
Competitor Scuderia Ferrari HP
Time 11:31
Session Reconnaissance Laps
Fact Car 16 continued on track with significant and obvious damage
InfringementBreach of Article 26.10 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations.
Decision Reprimand (Driving) This is the driver's first reprimand for the 2025 season.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 16 (Charles Leclerc), the team
representative and reviewed video evidence.
Car 16 hit the wall in Turn 10 and sustained significant damage. Nonetheless, the
driver continued on track (at a low speed) and only stopped before Turn 14, after
being told to do so by the team.
The Stewards note that incidents during the Reconnaissance Laps will be regarded in
the same way as incidents during Free Practice and therefore a reprimand is
considered appropriate.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
