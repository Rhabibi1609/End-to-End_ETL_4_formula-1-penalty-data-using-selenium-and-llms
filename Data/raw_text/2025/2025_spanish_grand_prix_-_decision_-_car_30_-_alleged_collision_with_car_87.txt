The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 30 - Liam Lawson
Competitor Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team
Time 15:45
Session Race
Fact Car 30 collided with Car 87 and forced Car 87 off the track at turn 1.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Articles 2 b) and 2 d) of the FIA
International Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing and in-car
video evidence and determined that Car 30 (Lawson) was attempting to overtake Car
87 (Bearman) on the inside of Turn 1. Car 30 was no where near the mirror of Car 87
at the apex.
There was minor contact between the two cars during this attempt and Car 87 took
the escape road. Both cars maintained their respective positions before the minor
collision. We therefore determined this to be a racing incident and took no further
action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
