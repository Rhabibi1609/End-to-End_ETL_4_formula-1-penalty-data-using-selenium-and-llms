To The Stewards Date 16 March 2025
Time 11:21
Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Changes have been made to the set-up of the suspension of car number 87. Therefore car number
87 should now be required to start the Race from the pit lane according to Article 40.9 a) of the 2025
Formula One Sporting Regulations.
I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
