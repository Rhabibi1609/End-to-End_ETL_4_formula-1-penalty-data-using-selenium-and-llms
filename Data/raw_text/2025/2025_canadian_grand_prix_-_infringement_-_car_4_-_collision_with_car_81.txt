The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (documents 55 & 56)
and heard from the drivers and team representatives, have considered the following matter and
determine the following:
No / Driver 4 - Lando Norris
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 15:27
Session Race
Fact Car 4 collided with Car 81 on the start/finish straight.
InfringementBreach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International Sporting Code.
Decision 5 second time penalty.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 4 (Lando Norris), the driver of Car 81
(Oscar Piastri), team representatives and video and in-car video evidence.
Car 4 was attempting to overtake Car 81 on the main straight. He attempted to move
to the left of Car 81 but there was no space. The driver of Car 4 said that he thought
there might be space but realised too late that there was not and he collided with Car
81. While Car 4 sustained damage and retired from the race (but was nonetheless
classified in the results), Car 81 was not damaged.
The Stewards determined that the driver of Car 4 was solely to blame for the collision.
Because the collision had no immediate and obvious sporting consequence, we
imposed a 5 second time post-race time penalty on Car 4.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
