Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race in Barcelona, car number 16 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more
extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections was the brake system. In particular, the following aspects of the
rear brake system were inspected:
TR Article 8.3: Homologation status of all sensors and actuators connected to the Standard ECU
relating to the rear brake system.
TR Article 11.1: System failure modes.
TR Article 11.1: Potential mechanisms capable of producing asymmetric braking torque across the
rear axle.
TR Article 11.4: Verification that pressure in the rear calipers does not exceed that generated by
the applied brake pedal force.
TD001: Accuracy of submitted schematics compared to the physical implementation of the
system.
All inspected components were found to be in compliance with the 2025 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
