Infringement Alleged breach of Article 33.4 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations and
Article 12.2.1 i) of the FIA International Sporting Code (non-compliance with the
Race Director’s Event Notes, item 1, document 19)
Decision No further action.
Reasons The Stewards thoroughly reviewed Marshalling/Positioning data, timing data, on-
board cameras and CCTV cameras.
All drivers concerned stayed at or above speeds necessary to stay below 1:21.0
around the vast majority of the circuit. However, in all cases the Stewards
determined that the drivers took appropriate actions to not impede other drivers,
and in all cases, they slowed down significantly to allow other drivers to pass
while giving those drivers a clear track. In the case of Hadjar, while he did not let
any other cars past, for most of the lap he was travelling behind another car also
on a preparation lap and had little alternative but to maintain a consistent gap to
that car to ensure his push lap was not compromised. The Stewards therefore
determine that all drivers concerned did not drive “unnecessarily slowly”, and that
they were above the maximum time because they took appropriate steps, and we
therefore take no further action.
Note Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
