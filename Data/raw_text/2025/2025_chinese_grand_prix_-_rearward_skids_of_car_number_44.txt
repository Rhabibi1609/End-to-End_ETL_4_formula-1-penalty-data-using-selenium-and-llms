Technical Delegate’s Report
The skid wear of car number 44 was checked.
The rearmost skid was measured according to the team’s legality documents submission in
accordance with TD039 L, item 1.2 b) i). Measurements were taken along the stiffness compliant
area at three different points of the periphery (inner arc). The recorded measurement were 8.6 mm
(LHS), 8.6 mm (car centerline) and 8.5 mm (RHS).
As this is less than the 9 mm minimum thickness required by TR Article 3.5.9 e), I am referring this
matter to the stewards for their consideration.
