Fact The thickness of the plank assembly was below the permitted minimum thickness.
InfringementBreach of Article 3.5.9 e) of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations.
Decision Car 27 is disqualified from the Race classification. All other drivers move up in the
classification.
Reason The Stewards heard from the team representative of Car 27 (Nico Hulkenberg).
The plank assembly of Car 27 was measured and found to be 8.4mm (LHS), 8.5mm
(car centerline) and 8.4mm (RHS). This is below the minimum thickness of 9mm
specified under Article 3.5.9 e) of the Technical Regulations.
During the hearing the team representative confirmed that the measurement is
correct and that all required procedures were performed correctly. The team also
acknowledged that it was a genuine error by the team.
The Stewards determine that Article 3.5.9 e) of the FIA Formula One Technical
Regulations has been breached and therefore the standard penalty of a
disqualification needs to be applied for such an infringement.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
