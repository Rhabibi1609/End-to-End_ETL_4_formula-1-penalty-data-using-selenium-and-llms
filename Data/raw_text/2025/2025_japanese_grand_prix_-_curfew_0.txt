Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
Last night team personnel of the BWT Alpine Formula One Team, who are associated with the
operation of the car, were within the confines of the circuit during the twelve and a half (12.5) hour
period which commenced at 20:00 on 04 April, fifteen and a half (15.5) hours before the scheduled
start time of P3 and ends three (3) hours before the scheduled start time of P3 at 08:30 on 05 April.
This was the first of the two (2) individual exceptions permitted for the BWT Alpine Formula One
Team during the 2025 Formula One Championship season and therefore no action should be taken.
