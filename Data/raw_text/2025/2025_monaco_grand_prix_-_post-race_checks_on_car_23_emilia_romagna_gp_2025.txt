Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
After the race in Imola, car number 23 was randomly chosen among the top ten cars for more
extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections were all front and rear inboard suspension components, the
front and rear dampers as well as all attached sensors, their loom routing and connections to the
SECU and other units.
All inspected components were found to be in conformance with the 2025 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
