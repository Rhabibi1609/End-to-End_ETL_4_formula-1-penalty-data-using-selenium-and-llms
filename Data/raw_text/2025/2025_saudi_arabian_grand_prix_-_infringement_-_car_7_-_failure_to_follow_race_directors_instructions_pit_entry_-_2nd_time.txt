BWT Alpine Formula 1 Team
Time 17:48
The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 26) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 7 - Jack Doohan
Competitor BWT Alpine Formula 1 Team
Time 16:43
Session Practice 3
Fact Car 7 crossed the painted area between the pit entry and the track.
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Director’s Event Note (item 13.4, document 8).
Decision Reprimand (Driving)
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 7 (Jack Doohan), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, team radio and in-car video
evidence and determined that Car 7 crossed the painted area between the pit entry
and the track for the second time during FP3.
It was made clear in the event notes that no part of the tyre must cross the line in any
direction.
There is no doubt that this prohibition was breached for a second time.
The team warned the driver about the first infringement and asked him to be careful.
Despite being warned, DOO crossed the painted area again.
The Race Director’s event notes were clear and because this was a second
infringement of a stated prohibition, we imposed a reprimand (driving).
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
