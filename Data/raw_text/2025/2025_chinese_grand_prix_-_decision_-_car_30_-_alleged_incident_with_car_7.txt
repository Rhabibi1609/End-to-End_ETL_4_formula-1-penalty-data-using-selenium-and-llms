The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, have considered the following
matter and determine the following:
No / Driver 30 - Liam Lawson
Competitor Oracle Red Bull Racing
Time 11:10
Session Sprint
Fact Incident with car 7 in turn 14.
InfringementAlleged breach of Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2 d) of the FIA International
Sporting Code.
Decision No further action.
Reason The Stewards reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, timing, telemetry,
team radio and in-car video evidence and determined as follows:
Car 30 (LAW) overtook Car 7 (DOO) at Turn 14 and there was a minor collision at
the exit.
We applied the Driving Standards Guidelines as a guide to determine who had the
right to the corner. Applying those guidelines, it is clear that LAW was well ahead of
DOO at the apex of the corner and was entitled to use the full track at the exit.
DOO should therefore have given LAW sufficient room to overtake and his failure to
do so resulted in a minor collision. As the resulting collision was minor, we took no
further action.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
