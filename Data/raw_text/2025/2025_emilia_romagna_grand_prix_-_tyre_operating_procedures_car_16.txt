Technical Delegateâ€™s Report
During free practice session 1, it was noticed that the LHS and RHS front tyre pressure of Set
16602 on Car 16 was altered after a run, whilst the car was stationary in the garage and before
going out for another run using the same set. This adjustment was not carried out in accordance with
the procedures set out in TD003Q 2. g. ii..
I am referring this matter to the stewards for their consideration.
