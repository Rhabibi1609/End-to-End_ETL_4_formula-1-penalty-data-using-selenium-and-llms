Technical Delegate’s Report
After the race in Shanghai, car numbers 16 and 44 were randomly chosen among the top ten cars
for more extensive physical inspections.
Subject to these physical inspections was the pit stop equipment and related control systems. In
detail the following items were checked:
Logged data supplied post-race was cross checked against the team’s raw data.
The control logic, that is stipulated in TD022, was checked by means of:
Physical and visual checks during mock pit stops.
Data validated from both, the race and these mock pit stops.
Control unit source code review.
All information required by TD022 has been checked against the information supplied on the
declaration FTP site.
All inspected items were found to be in conformance with the 2025 Formula One Technical
Regulations.
