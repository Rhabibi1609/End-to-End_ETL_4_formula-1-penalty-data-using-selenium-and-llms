The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 26) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 81 - Oscar Piastri
Competitor McLaren Formula 1 Team
Time 11:44
Session Practice 3
Fact Car 81 overtook several cars in the Fast Lane whilst traversing the Working Lane to
the Practice Start Area
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Directorâ€™s Event Note (item 11, document 22).
Decision Formal Warning for the Driver
Formal Warning for the Team.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 81 (Oscar Piastri), the team
representative and reviewed video evidence.
Car 81 overtook several cars whilst remaining in the working lane however it was
noted that a review of video from Car 4 (NOR) showed that due to the location of the
McLaren garage, it was logical to drive directly from the garage to the practice start
area. The Stewards also note that the driver of Car 81 did in fact perform a genuine
practice start and tried to rejoin in the position he would have been in, had he been in
the fast lane.
In relation to the general subject of overtaking in the pit lane, the fact that a warning
was issued for the 4 cases this weekend is not to be taken as a precedent and the
Stewards note that future breaches of pit lane procedures may involve a sporting
penalty.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
