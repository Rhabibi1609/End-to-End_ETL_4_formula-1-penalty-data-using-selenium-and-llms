The Stewards, having received a report from the Race Director, summoned (document 11) and
heard from the driver and team representative, have considered the following matter and determine
the following:
No / Driver 30 - Liam Lawson
Competitor Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team
Time 16:44
Session Practice 1
Fact Car 30 entered the painted area between the pit entry and the track.
InfringementBreach of Article 12.2.1 i) of the International Sporting Code and non-compliance with
Race Director’s Event Note (item 13.4, document 2).
Decision Warning.
Reason The Stewards heard from the driver of Car 30 (Liam Lawson), team representative
and reviewed positioning/marshalling system data, video, team radio and in-car video
evidence and determined that Car 30 entered the painted area between the pit entry
and the track.
It was made clear in the event notes that no part of the tyre must cross the line in any
direction.
There is no doubt that this prohibition was breached. As this was during Free
Practice, we did not think a more severe penalty than a warning was necessary.
Competitors are reminded that they have the right to appeal certain decisions of the
Stewards, in accordance with Article 15 of the FIA International Sporting Code and
Chapter 4 of the FIA Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, within the applicable time limits.
Decisions of the Stewards are taken independently of the FIA and are based solely
on the relevant regulations, guidelines and evidence presented.
